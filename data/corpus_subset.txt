28001369	Stem Cell Transcriptome Responses and Corresponding Biomarkers That Indicate the Transition from Adaptive Responses to DISEASE_D064420_Cytotoxicity.
28001369	Analysis of transcriptome changes has become an established method to characterize the reaction of cells to toxicants.
28001369	Such experiments are mostly performed at compound concentrations close to the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity threshold.
28001369	At present, little information is available on concentration-dependent features of transcriptome changes, in particular, at the transition from noncytotoxic concentrations to conditions that are associated with cell death.
28001369	Thus, it is unclear in how far cell death confounds the results of transcriptome studies.
28001369	To explore this gap of knowledge, we treated pluripotent stem cells differentiating to SPECIES_9606_human neuroepithelial cells (UKN1 assay) for short periods (48 h) with increasing concentrations of CHEMICAL_D014635_valproic_acid (CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA) and CHEMICAL_30785_methyl_mercury (CHEMICAL__MeHg), two compounds with vastly different modes of action.
28001369	We developed various visualization tools to describe cellular responses, and the overall response was classified as "tolerance" (minor transcriptome changes), "functional adaptation" (moderate/strong transcriptome responses, but no DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity), and "degeneration".
28001369	The latter two conditions were compared, using various statistical approaches.
28001369	We identified (i) genes regulated at cytotoxic, but not at noncytotoxic, concentrations and (ii) KEGG pathways, gene ontology term groups, and superordinate biological processes that were only regulated at cytotoxic concentrations.
28001369	The consensus markers and processes found after 48 h treatment were then overlaid with those found after prolonged (6 days) treatment.
28001369	The study highlights the importance of careful concentration selection and of controlling viability for transcriptome studies.
28001369	Moreover, it allowed identification of 39 candidate "biomarkers of DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity".
28001369	These could serve to provide alerts that data sets of interest may have been affected by cell death in the model system studied.
28003368	GENE_89910_UBE3B Is a GENE_801_Calmodulin-regulated, Mitochondrion-associated E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.
28003368	Recent genome-wide studies found that SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D009123_hypotonia, DISEASE_D002658_developmental_delay, DISEASE_D009069_intellectual_disability, DISEASE_D000013_congenital_anomalies, characteristic facial DISEASE_D000013_dysmorphic_features, and low CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol levels suffer from DISEASE_C537013_Kaufman_oculocerebrofacial_syndrome (DISEASE_C537013_KOS, also reported as DISEASE_D001763_blepharophimosis_ptosis-DISEASE_D009069_intellectual_disability_syndrome).
28003368	The primary cause of DISEASE_C537013_KOS is autosomal recessive mutations in the gene GENE_89910_UBE3B However, to date, there are no studies that have determined the cellular or enzymatic function of GENE_89910_UBE3B.
28003368	Here, we report that GENE_89910_UBE3B is a mitochondrion-associated protein with homologous to the GENE_7337_E6_AP Cterminus (HECT) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
28003368	Mutating the catalytic CHEMICAL_D003545_cysteine (DNAMUTATION_c|SUB|C|1036|A_C1036A) or deleting the entire HECT domain (CHEMICAL_D000596_amino_acids 758-1068) results in loss of GENE_89910_UBE3B's ubiquitylation activity.
28003368	Knockdown of GENE_89910_UBE3B in SPECIES_9606_human cells induces changes in mitochondrial morphology and physiology, a decrease in mitochondrial volume, and a severe suppression of cellular proliferation.
28003368	We also discovered that GENE_89910_UBE3B interacts with GENE_801_calmodulin via its CHEMICAL__N-terminal CHEMICAL_24898_isoleucine-CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamine (IQ) motif.
28003368	Deletion of the IQ motif (CHEMICAL_D000596_amino_acids 29-58) results in loss of GENE_801_calmodulin binding and a significant increase in the in vitro ubiquitylation activity of GENE_89910_UBE3B.
28003368	In addition, we found that changes in CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium levels in vitro disrupt the GENE_801_calmodulin-GENE_89910_UBE3B interaction.
28003368	These studies demonstrate that GENE_89910_UBE3B is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and reveal that the enzyme is regulated by GENE_801_calmodulin.
28003368	Furthermore, the modulation of GENE_89910_UBE3B via GENE_801_calmodulin and CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium implicates a role for CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium signaling in mitochondrial protein ubiquitylation, protein turnover, and disease.
28004443	Amyloid b induces GENE_114548_NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelial cells via CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-dependent DISEASE_D000860_ROS production.
28004443	Amyloid b (Ab)-induced DISEASE_D007249_chronic_inflammation is believed to be a key pathogenic process in early-stage DISEASE_D008268_age_related_macular_degeneration (DISEASE_D008268_AMD).
28004443	CHEMICAL_D009711_Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (GENE_114548_NLRP3) inflammasome activation triggered by Ab is responsible for DISEASE_D012164_retinal_pigment_epithelium (DISEASE_D012164_RPE) dysfunction in the onset of DISEASE_D008268_AMD; however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear.
28004443	In this study, we investigated the involvement of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived DISEASE_D000860_reactive_oxygen_species (DISEASE_D000860_ROS) in the process of Ab1-40 -induced GENE_114548_NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19 cells.
28004443	The results showed that Ab1-40 could induce excessive DISEASE_D000860_ROS generation, MAPK/NF-kB signaling activation and subsequently GENE_114548_NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19 cells.
28004443	Furthermore, the inductive effect of Ab1-40 on GENE_114548_NLRP3 inflammasome activation was mediated in a manner dependent on CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived DISEASE_D000860_ROS.
28004443	Our findings may provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which Ab contributes to the early-stage DISEASE_D008268_AMD.
28002765	Developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_dichlorophenoxyacetic_acid in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish SPECIES_6239_embryos.
28002765	CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_Dichlorophenoxyacetic_acid (CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D) is widely used in agriculture as herbicide/pesticide, plant  growth regulator and fruit preservative agent.
28002765	It progressively accumulates in the environment including surface water, air and soil.
28002765	It could be detected in SPECIES_9606_human food and urine, which poses great  risk to the living organisms.
28002765	In the present study, we investigated the developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D on SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) SPECIES_6239_embryo.
28002765	CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D exposure significantly decreased both the survival rate  (LC50  =  46.71  mg/L) and hatching rate (IC50  =  46.26  mg/L) of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish SPECIES_6239_embryos.
28002765	The most  common DISEASE_D002658_developmental_defect in CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D treated SPECIES_6239_embryos was pericardial DISEASE_D004487_edema.
28002765	CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D (25  mg/L) upregulated marker genes of cardiac development (vmhc, amhc, hand2, vegf, and gata1) and downregulated marker genes of oxidative stress (cat and gpx1a).
28002765	Whole mount in situ hybridization confirmed the vmhc and amhc upregulation by CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D treatment.
28002765	LC/MS/MS showed that the bioaccumulation of CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish SPECIES_6239_embryos were increased in a time-dependent manner after 25  mg/L of CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D treatment.
28002765	Taken together, our study investigated the toxic effects of CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D on  SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryonic development and its potential molecular mechanisms, gave evidence for the full understanding of CHEMICAL_D015084_2_4_D DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on living organisms and shed light on its environmental impact.
28003439	From the Cover: Prolonged Exposure to Volatile Anesthetic CHEMICAL_D007530_Isoflurane Worsens the Outcome of Polymicrobial Abdominal DISEASE_D018805_Sepsis.
28003439	DISEASE_D018805_Sepsis continues to result in high morbidity and mortality.
28003439	General anesthesia is often administered to septic SPECIES_9606_patients, but the impacts of general anesthesia on host defense are not well understood.
28003439	General anesthesia can be given by volatile and intravenous anesthetics.
28003439	Our previous in vitro study showed that volatile anesthetic CHEMICAL_D007530_isoflurane directly inhibits GENE_10090)_leukocyte_function_associated_antigen_1 (GENE_10090)_LFA_1) and GENE_10090)_macrophage_1_antigen (GENE_10090)_Mac_1), critical adhesion molecules on leukocytes.
28003439	Thus, the role of CHEMICAL_D007530_isoflurane exposure on in vivo GENE_10090)_LFA_1 and GENE_10090)_Mac_1 function was examined using polymicrobial DISEASE_D000008_abdominal_sepsis model in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28003439	As a comparison, intravenous anesthetic CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol was given to a group of SPECIES_10090_mice.
28003439	Wild type, GENE_10090)_LFA_1, GENE_10090)_Mac_1, and adhesion molecule-1 knockout SPECIES_10090_mice were used.
28003439	Following the induction of polymicrobial DISEASE_D000008_abdominal_sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture, groups of SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to CHEMICAL_D007530_isoflurane for either 2 or 6   h, or to CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol for 6   h, and their outcomes were examined.
28003439	SPECIES_2_Bacterial loads in tissues and blood, neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneal cavity and phagocytosis were studied.
28003439	Six hours of CHEMICAL_D007530_isoflurane exposure worsened the outcome of DISEASE_D000008_abdominal_sepsis (P < .0001) with higher SPECIES_2_bacterial loads in tissues, but 2   h of CHEMICAL_D007530_isoflurane or 6   h of CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol exposure did not.
28003439	CHEMICAL_D007530_Isoflurane impaired neutrophil recruitment to the abdominal cavity by inhibiting GENE_10090)_LFA_1 function.
28003439	CHEMICAL_D007530_Isoflurane also impaired SPECIES_2_bacterial phagocytosis via complement receptors including GENE_10090)_Mac_1.
28003439	In conclusion, prolonged CHEMICAL_D007530_isoflurane exposure worsened the outcome of experimental polymicrobial DISEASE_D000008_abdominal_sepsis and was associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment and SPECIES_2_bacterial phagocytosis via reduced GENE_10090)_LFA_1 and GENE_10090)_Mac_1 function.
28009930	Incorporation of a metabolizing system in biodetection assays for endocrine active substances.
28009930	UNASSIGNED: The use of in vitro assays is important for the biodetection of endocrine active substances (EAS), reducing and replacing the in vivo studies required for regulatory assessment.
28009930	However, this approach often fails to take into account the role of biotransformation on the activity of the test substances.
28009930	A method incorporating an S9 metabolic system into the CALUX-reporter gene assays for CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor a- and anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor -mediated activities has been developed.
28009930	CHEMICAL_D008731_Methoxychlor, which is known to exhibit increased estrogenic and anti-androgenic activities after biotransformation, was used to set up the method in GENE_2099_ERa and anti-AR CALUX.
28009930	For the anti-androgenic assay, CHEMICAL_D013197_stanozolol was used as a competing agonist not metabolized by S9.
28009930	The method was first applied in both agonist and antagonist modes to CHEMICAL_D008731_methoxychlor and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A, as positive and negative controls, respectively.
28009930	Then, CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene and CHEMICAL_D005485_flutamide were also tested for their potential of bioactivation.
28009930	Co-treatment with S9 successfully increased the GENE_2099_ERa agonist and AR antagonist potency of CHEMICAL_D008731_methoxychlor; no change was observed for CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A.
28009930	Incubation with S9 also enhanced the anti-androgenic activity of CHEMICAL_D005485_flutamide.
28009930	Interestingly, the metabolism of CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene by the S9 resulted in an increased CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional activation; any increase in the potency was only minor.
28009930	It is likely that both enzyme kinetics and metabolite stability have influenced these effects, which would affect the composition of the final metabolite mixture.
28009930	Together these results demonstrate the relevance of including biotransformation in in vitro bioassays for the detection of EAS.
28011299	Apoptosis inducing factor gene depletion inhibits CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone-induced cell death in a SPECIES_9925_goat Leydig cell line.
28011299	CHEMICAL_D015025_Zearalenone (CHEMICAL__ZEA) is a contaminant of SPECIES_9606_human food and animal feedstuffs that causes health hazards.
28011299	However, the signal pathways underlying DISEASE_D064420_ZEA_toxicity remain elusive.
28011299	The aims of this study were to determine which pathways are involved in CHEMICAL__ZEA-induced cell death and investigate the effect of apoptosis inducing factor (GENE_9131_AIF) on cell death during CHEMICAL__ZEA treatment in the immortalized SPECIES_9925_goat Leydig cell line hTERT-GLC.
28011299	This study showed that CHEMICAL__ZEA-induced cell death in hTERT-GLCs works via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the caspase-dependent pathway, the caspase-independent pathway and autophagy.
28011299	Recombinant SPECIES_11646_lentiviral vectors were constructed to silence GENE_9131_AIF expression in hTERT-GLCs.
28011299	Flow cytometry results showed that knockdown of GENE_9131_AIF diminished CHEMICAL__ZEA-induced cell apoptosis in hTERT-GLCs.
28011299	Furthermore, we found GENE_9131_AIF depletion down-regulated phosphoIRE1a, GENE_3309_GRP78, GENE_1649_CHOP and promoted the switch of LC3-I to LC3-II.
28011299	Therefore, CHEMICAL__ZEA induces DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity in hTERT-GLCs via different pathways, while GENE_9131_AIF-mediated signaling plays a critical role in CHEMICAL__ZEA-induced cell death in hTERT-GLCs.
28012895	CHEMICAL_C531013_Protocatechuic_acid_methyl_ester ameliorates CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in A549 cells.
28012895	The present study is aimed to determine the potential benefits of CHEMICAL_C531013_protocatechuic_acid_methyl_ester (CHEMICAL__PCAME) against CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride (CHEMICAL__F_sup_sup_) induced DISEASE_D008171_lung_toxicity using A549 cells.
28012895	The cells were treated with CHEMICAL_D012969_sodium_fluoride (GENE_3576_NaF) alone and in combination with CHEMICAL__PCAME for different time points (0-24  h) and evaluated for intracellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) production, F<sup>-</sup>content, oxidative stress markers, apoptosis and mRNA expression of redox signaling and inflammatory genes.
28012895	The results shown that CHEMICAL__PCAME alleviates the toxic effects of CHEMICAL__F_sup_sup_via modulating its bioavailability, intracellular CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium level, mitochondrial membrane integrity and redox signaling in A549 cells.
28012895	F<sup>-</sup>induced changes in ROS generation, oxidative stress markers, TUNEL positive cells and mRNA levels of inflammatory genes were further normalized by CHEMICAL__PCAME.
28012895	Taken together, these findings revealed that CHEMICAL__PCAME effectively attenuated the F<sup>-</sup>induced changes in oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis markers by reducing its cellular content, ROS generation and biochemical and molecular changes.
28012895	Thus CHEMICAL__PCAME can be used as a nutraceutical agent for F<sup>-</sup>DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28011154	Persistent organic pollutants alter DNA methylation during SPECIES_9606_human adipocyte differentiation.
28011154	Ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can accumulate in SPECIES_9606_humans where they might influence differentiation of adipocytes.
28011154	The aim of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation is one of the underlying mechanisms by which POPs affect adipocyte differentiation, and to what extent DNA methylation can be related to gene transcription.
28011154	Adipocyte differentiation was induced in two SPECIES_9606_human cell models with continuous exposure to different POPs throughout differentiation.
28011154	From the seven tested POPs, CHEMICAL_C076994_perfluorooctanesulfonic_acid (CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS) and CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) decreased lipid accumulation, while CHEMICAL_C011559_tributyltin (CHEMICAL_27086_TBT) increased lipid accumulation.
28011154	In SPECIES_9606_human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD and CHEMICAL_27086_TBT induced opposite gene expression profiles, whereas after CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS exposure gene expression remained relatively stable.
28011154	Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed that all three POPs affected DNA methylation patterns in adipogenic and other genes, possibly related to the phenotypic outcome, but without concomitant gene expression changes.
28011154	Differential methylation was predominantly detected in intergenic regions, where the biological relevance of alterations in DNA methylation is unclear.
28011154	This study demonstrates that POPs, at environmentally relevant levels, are able to induce differential DNA methylation in SPECIES_9606_human differentiating adipocytes.
28013212	Editor's Highlight: Organ-Specific Epigenetic Changes Induced by the Nongenotoxic Liver Carcinogen CHEMICAL_D008701_Methapyrilene in Fischer 344 SPECIES_10116_Rats.
28013212	Continuous lifetime exposure to certain natural and SPECIES_9606_man-made chemicals is a major cause of DISEASE_D009369_cancers in SPECIES_9606_humans; therefore, evaluating the carcinogenic risks of chemicals remains important.
28013212	Currently, substantial progress has been made in identification of genotoxic carcinogens; in contrast, predicting the carcinogenic potential of nongenotoxic compounds is a challenge due to many different modes of action that may lead to tumorigenesis.
28013212	In the present study, we investigated the effects of the nongenotoxic liver carcinogen CHEMICAL_D008701_methapyrilene and the nongenotoxic noncarcinogen CHEMICAL_C073339_usnic_acid, at doses that do not exhibit organ cytotoxicity, on epigenomic alterations in the livers and kidneys of Fischer 344 (F344) SPECIES_10116_rats.
28013212	We demonstrate that a repeat-dose oral treatment of SPECIES_9606_male F344 SPECIES_10116_rats with CHEMICAL_D008701_methapyrilene for 6 weeks caused target organ-specific epigenetic alterations in the livers.
28013212	In contrast, only very slight epigenetic changes were found in the livers of F344 SPECIES_10116_rats treated with hepatotoxicant, but noncarcinogen, CHEMICAL_C073339_usnic_acid.
28013212	The CHEMICAL_D008701_methapyrilene-induced epigenetic changes consisted of changes in histone CHEMICAL_25094_lysine acetylation and methylation, with the greatest increase occurring in global and gene-specific histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) deacetylation.
28013212	Importantly, the results of the present study show an association between gene-specific histone H3K9 deacetylation and a reduced expression of critical DISEASE_D009369_cancer-related genes, including GENE_5629_prospero_homeobox_1 (GENE_5629_Prox1), HNF1 homebox A (GENE_6927_Hnf1a), and GENE_5465_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_alpha (GENE_5465_Ppara), which provides a mechanistic link between CHEMICAL_D008701_methapyrilene-induced epigenetic aberrations and DISEASE_D008107_liver_carcinogenesis.
28013213	Environmental CHEMICAL__Xenoestrogens Super-Activate a Variant SPECIES_10090_Murine GENE_10090)_ER_Beta in Cholangiocytes.
28013213	High systemic levels of CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogens are cholestatic and DISEASE_D008105_primary_biliary_cholangitis (DISEASE_D008105_PBC)-which is characterized by DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_ductular_inflammation-is thought to be triggered by exposure to xenobiotics such as those around landfill sites.
28013213	CHEMICAL__Xenoestrogens may be a component of this chemical trigger.
28013213	We therefore hypothesized that CHEMICAL__xenoestrogens are present at higher levels in the proximity of landfill sites.
28013213	To test this hypothesis, soil samples were collected, extracts prepared and biological oestrogenic activity examined using cell-based reporter gene assays.
28013213	Extracts from several sample sites around a landfill site contained a chemical(s) which activated the SPECIES_9606_human GENE_26284_ERa in a dose-dependent manner.
28013213	Extracts from 3 separate control sampling sites were absent of any detectable activity.
28013213	The SPECIES_10090_mouse GENE_10090)_ERa_and_2 variant SPECIES_10090_mouse GENE_10090)_ERb cDNAs were cloned and extracts from sample sites around a landfill site also activated these receptors.
28013213	One variant SPECIES_10090_murine GENE_10090)_ERb was constitutively active when expressed in cholangiocytes, was readily inactivated by CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI182780 and activated in a dose-responsive, CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI182780-inhibitable manner by CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen.
28013213	However, when this receptor was activated by extracts from landfill site soils, CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI182780 failed to antagonize activation.
28013213	GENE_10090)_ERb was readily detectable in SPECIES_10090_murine cholangiocytes and exposing SPECIES_10090_mice acutely to a pooled ER activating soil extracts also gave rise to a mild DISEASE_D002779_cholestatic_injury.
28013213	These data indicate that the environment around landfill sites may contain higher levels of CHEMICAL__xenoestrogens; that these chemicals have "super-activating" characteristics with a variant GENE_2100_ERb and therefore these chemicals could be a component of a xenobiotic insult that triggers DISEASE_D008105_PBC.
28013214	Effects of an Environmentally Relevant CHEMICAL_C032279_Phthalate Mixture on Cultured SPECIES_10090_Mouse Antral Follicles.
28013214	CHEMICAL_26092_Phthalates are used in building materials, medical devices, and personal care products.
28013214	Most studies on CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates have focused on single CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates, but it is important to study mixtures of CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates because SPECIES_9606_humans are exposed to such mixtures daily.
28013214	We tested the hypothesis that CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate mixture exposure decreases antral follicle growth, compromises steroidogenic capacity, and induces DISEASE_D018633_atresia.
28013214	Antral follicles from adult SPECIES_10090_CD_1_mice were cultured with vehicle control or CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate mixture (1-500   g/ml) for 96   h. The mixture was made of 35% CHEMICAL_C007379_diethyl_phthalate, 21% CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate, 15% CHEMICAL_D003993_dibutyl_phthalate, 15% CHEMICAL_C012125_diisononyl_phthalate, 8% CHEMICAL_C025605_diisobutyl_phthalate, and 5% CHEMICAL_C027561_benzylbutyl_phthalate.
28013214	During culture, antral follicle diameters were measured every 24   h to monitor growth.
28013214	After culture, media were subjected to measurements of sex CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormones and follicles were subjected to evaluation of gene expression and DISEASE_D018633_atresia.
28013214	The CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate mixture (100 and 500   g/ml) decreased antral follicle growth starting at 24   h compared to controls.
28013214	The mixture at 10, 100, and 500   g/ml also decreased CHEMICAL_D000735_androstenedione, CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, CHEMICAL_D004970_estrone, and CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol levels compared to control.
28013214	The mixture (10, 100, and 500   g/ml) reduced DISEASE_D018633_atresia rating, but it induced more oocyte fragmentation compared to control.
28013214	The CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate mixture at different doses adversely affected cell cycle regulators, antioxidant enzymes, apoptotic factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and receptors.
28013214	Collectively, these data indicate that exposure to an environmentally relevant CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate mixture reduces antral follicle growth, induces oocyte fragmentation, and decreases hormone production by adversely affecting the expression of cell cycle regulators, apoptotic factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and receptors.
28013216	Diesel Exhaust Particles Contribute to Endothelia Apoptosis via Autophagy Pathway.
28013216	Epidemiological studies suggest that an increase of PM2.5 diesel exhaust particles (DEP) in ambient air corresponds to increased DISEASE_D009203_myocardial_infarctions and DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28013216	When exposed to DEP, endothelial cells exhibit increases in oxidative stress and apoptosis, but the role of autophagy in this DEP-induced cell death remains unclear.
28013216	Here, we suggest that acute DEP exposure produces intracellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) leading to induction of DEP internalization, DISEASE_D008107_endothelial_dysfunction, and DISEASE_D007249_pro_inflammation in an in vitro SPECIES_9606_human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) model.
28013216	This study found that increases in intracellular oxidative stress and cellular internalization of DEP occurred within 2   h of exposure to DEP.
28013216	After 2   h of DEP exposure, GENE_4193_Mdm2 expression was increased, which triggered cellular autophagy after 4   h of DEP exposure and suppressed cellular senescence.
28013216	Unfortunately, phagocytized DEP could not be eliminated by cellular autophagy, which led to a continuous buildup of ROS, an increased release of cytokines, and an increased expression of anchoring molecules.
28013216	After 12   h of DEP exposure, HUVEC reduced GENE_4193_Mdm2 expression leading to increased GENE_7157_p53 expression, which triggered apoptosis and ultimately resulted in DISEASE_D008107_endothelial_dysfunction.
28013216	On the other hand, when cells lacked the ability to induce autophagy, DEP was unable to induce cell senescence and most of the cells survived with only a small percentage of the cells undergoing DISEASE_D009336_necrosis.
28013216	The results presented in this study clearly demonstrate the role cellular autophagy plays in DEP-induced DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28013218	Editor's Highlight: Genetic Targets of Acute CHEMICAL_D014050_Toluene Inhalation in SPECIES_7227_Drosophila_melanogaster.
28013218	Interpretation and use of data from high-throughput assays for DISEASE_D064420_chemical_toxicity require links between effects at molecular targets and adverse outcomes in whole animals.
28013218	The well-characterized genome of SPECIES_7227_Drosophila_melanogaster provides a potential model system by which phenotypic responses to chemicals can be mapped to genes associated with those responses, which may in turn suggest adverse outcome pathways associated with those genes.
28013218	To determine the utility of this approach, we used the SPECIES_7227_Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP), a collection of    200 homozygous lines of SPECIES_7227_fruit_flies whose genomes have been sequenced.
28013218	We quantified CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene-induced suppression of motor activity in 123 lines of these SPECIES_7227_flies during exposure to CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene, a volatile organic compound known to induce DISEASE_D053608_narcosis in mammals via its effects on neuronal ion channels.
28013218	We then applied genome-wide association analyses on this effect of CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene using the DGRP web portal (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu), which identified polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with the variation in response to CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene exposure.
28013218	We tested    2 million variants and found 82 polymorphisms located in or near 66 candidate genes that were associated with phenotypic variation for sensitivity to CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene at P   <   5 * 10-5, and SPECIES_9606_human orthologs for 52 of these candidate SPECIES_7227_Drosophila genes.
28013218	None of these orthologs are known to be involved in canonical pathways for SPECIES_9606_mammalian neuronal ion channels, including CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA, CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate, CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine, CHEMICAL_D005998_glycine, CHEMICAL_D012701_serotonin, and voltage sensitive CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium channels.
28013218	Thus this analysis did not reveal a genetic signature consistent with processes previously shown to be involved in CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene-induced DISEASE_D053608_narcosis in mammals.
28013218	The list of the SPECIES_9606_human orthologs included Gene Ontology terms associated with signaling, nervous system development and embryonic morphogenesis; these orthologs may provide insight into potential new pathways that could mediate the narcotic effects of CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene.
28025108	CHEMICAL_D004051_Di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate could disrupt the insulin signaling pathway in liver of SD SPECIES_10116_rats and L02 cells via PPARy.
28025108	CHEMICAL_D004051_Di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP), a ubiquitous industrial pollutant in our daily life, has been reported to cause adverse effects on DISEASE_D018149_glucose_homeostasis_and_insulin_sensitivity in epidemiological studies previously.
28025108	Recently, it has been reported to be an endocrine disrupter and ligand to peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, which could influence the homeostasis of liver metabolic systems and contribute to the development of type-2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes.
28025108	However, the potential mechanisms are not known yet.
28025108	This study was designed to solve these problems with male SD SPECIES_10116_rats and normal SPECIES_9606_human hepatocyte line, L02 cells, exposed to CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP for toxicological experiments.
28025108	Adult male SD SPECIES_10116_rats were divided into four groups, normal group fed with regular diets and three CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP-treated groups (dissolved in olive oil at doses of 0.05, 5 and 500mg/kg body weight, respectively, once daily through gastric intubations for 15weeks).
28025108	L02 cells were divided into 6 groups, normal group with 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mol/l CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP groups.
28025108	CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP-exposed SPECIES_10116_rats exhibited significant DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance along with reduced expression of GENE_10116)_insulin_receptor and GENE_10116)_GLUT4 proteins in the liver tissues.
28025108	The results of in vitro experiments could determine that the CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP-induced activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor y (PPARy) played a key role in the production of oxidative stress and down-regulated expression of GENE_10116)_insulin_receptor and GENE_10116)_GLUT4 proteins in L02 cells.
28025108	This conclusion could be supported by the results of in vitro experiments, in which the cells were exposed to CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP with CHEMICAL_C457499_GW9662 (PPARy inhibitor).
28025108	In general, these results highlight the key role of PPARy in the process of insulin resistance induced by CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP.
28025122	Protective effect of CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine against CHEMICAL_64090_t_BHP-induced hepatotoxicity by upregulating antioxidant enzymes via the GENE_10090)_CaMKII-GENE_10090)_Akt and GENE_10090)_Nrf2/ARE pathways.
28025122	CHEMICAL_C028632_Rutaecarpine, an CHEMICAL__indolopyridoquinazolinone alkaloid isolated from the unripe fruit of Evodia rutaecarpa, has been shown to have cytoprotective potential, but the molecular mechanism underlying this activity remains unclear.
28025122	Our study was designed to investigate the cytoprotective effect of CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine against CHEMICAL_D020122_tert_butyl_hydroperoxide (CHEMICAL_64090_t_BHP) and to elucidate its action mechanism of action of CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine in a cultured HepG2 cell line and in SPECIES_10090_mouse liver.
28025122	CHEMICAL_C028632_Rutaecarpine decreased CHEMICAL_64090_t_BHP-induced reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) production, DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, and apoptosis in HepG2 cells.
28025122	Pretreatment with CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine prior to the injection of CHEMICAL_64090_t_BHP significantly prevented the increase in serum levels of AST, ALT, and lipid peroxidation in SPECIES_10090_mice liver.
28025122	It increased the transcriptional activity of GENE_10090)_NF_E2_related_factor_2 (GENE_10090)_Nrf2) as well as the products of the GENE_10090)_Nrf2 target genes hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), GENE_10090)_NAD_P_H_quinone_oxidoreductase_1 (GENE_10090)_NQO1), and DISEASE_C565659_glutamate_cysteine_ligase (DISEASE_C565659_GCL).
28025122	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine also enhanced the phosphorylation of GENE_10090)_Akt and GENE_10090)_Ca_2_calmodulin_dependent_protein_kinase_II (GENE_10090)_CaMKII).
28025122	The pharmaceutical inhibitors, such as CHEMICAL_C072105_KN_93 (GENE_10090)_CaMKII inhibitor) and CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002 (GENE_10090)_Akt inhibitor) suppressed CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine-induced HO-1 expression and cytoprotection.
28025122	Our findings identify the GENE_10090)_CaMKII-PI3K/GENE_10090)_Akt-GENE_10090)_Nrf2 cascade as an antioxidant pathway mediating CHEMICAL_C028632_rutaecarpine signaling and leading to HO-1 expression in hepatocytes.
28027439	CHEMICAL_28616_Carbamate Insecticides Target SPECIES_9606_Human CHEMICAL_D008550_Melatonin Receptors.
28027439	CHEMICAL_D012721_Carbaryl (CHEMICAL__1_naphthyl_methylcarbamate) and CHEMICAL_D002235_carbofuran (CHEMICAL__2_3_dihydro_2_2_dimethyl_7_benzofuranyl_methylcarbamate) are among the most toxic insecticides, implicated in a variety of diseases including DISEASE_D003920_diabetes and DISEASE_D009369_cancer among others.
28027439	Using an integrated pharmacoinformatics based screening approach, we have identified these insecticides to be structural mimics of the neurohormone CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin and were able to bind to the putative CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin binding sites in GENE_56052_MT1 and GENE_4502_MT2 CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin receptors in silico.
28027439	CHEMICAL_D012721_Carbaryl and CHEMICAL_D002235_carbofuran then were tested for competition with CHEMICAL__2_125_I_iodomelatonin (300 pM) binding to GENE_56052_hMT1 or GENE_4502_hMT2 receptors stably expressed in CHO cells.
28027439	CHEMICAL_D012721_Carbaryl and CHEMICAL_D002235_carbofuran showed higher affinity for competition with CHEMICAL__2_125_I_iodomelatonin binding to the GENE_4502_hMT2 compared to the GENE_56052_hMT1 CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin receptor (33 and 35-fold difference, respectively) as predicted by the molecular modeling.
28027439	In the presence of CHEMICAL_D006160_GTP (100  M), which decouples the G-protein linked receptors to modulate signaling, the apparent efficacy of CHEMICAL_D012721_carbaryl and CHEMICAL_D002235_carbofuran for CHEMICAL__2_125_I_iodomelatonin binding for the GENE_56052_hMT1 CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin receptor was not affected but significantly decreased for the GENE_4502_hMT2 CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin receptor compatible with receptor antagonist/inverse agonist and agonist efficacy, respectively.
28027439	Altogether, our data points to a potentially new mechanism through which CHEMICAL_28616_carbamate insecticides CHEMICAL_D012721_carbaryl and CHEMICAL_D002235_carbofuran could impact SPECIES_9606_human health by altering the homeostatic balance of key regulatory processes by directly binding to CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin receptors.
28027979	The impairment of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic b-cells caused by prolonged glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity is associated with elevated adaptive antioxidant response.
28027979	DISEASE_D003924_Type_2_diabetes (DISEASE_D003924_T2D) is a progressive disease characterized by sustained DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia and is frequently accompanied by DISEASE_D006949_hyperlipidemia.
28027979	Deterioration of b-cell function in DISEASE_D003924_T2D SPECIES_9606_patients may be caused, in part, by long-term exposure to high concentrations of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and/or lipids.
28027979	We developed systems to study how chronic glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity might be linked to the impairment of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) machinery in pancreatic b-cells.
28027979	GENE_2305_INS_1 (832/13) were exposed to CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and/or CHEMICAL_7896_palmitate for up to 10 weeks.
28027979	Chronic high DISEASE_D018149_glucose_and_or_palmitate exposure resulted in impaired GSIS accompanied by a dramatic increase in oxidative stress, as determined by basal intracellular CHEMICAL_44785_peroxide levels.
28027979	In addition, the GSIS-associated reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) signals, assessed as CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated CHEMICAL_44785_peroxide accumulation positively correlated with GSIS in CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose- and/or CHEMICAL_7896_palmitate-exposed cells, as well as CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated reductions in CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH/CHEMICAL_D019803_GSSG ratios.
28027979	Furthermore, the impairment of GSIS caused by chronic high DISEASE_D018149_glucose_and_or_palmitate exposures were attributed to the induction of adaptive antioxidant response and mitochondrial uncoupling, which negatively regulates CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-derived ROS generation.
28027979	Taken together, persistent glucotoxicity- and/or lipotoxicity-mediated oxidative stress and subsequent adaptive antioxidant response impair CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-derived ROS signaling and GSIS in pancreatic b-cells.
28029781	CHEMICAL__Aryl_Hydrocarbon Receptor Activation Contributes to CHEMICAL_C012768_Benzanthrone-Induced DISEASE_D017495_Hyperpigmentation via Modulation of Melanogenic Signaling Pathways.
28029781	CHEMICAL_C012768_Benzanthrone (BA), an oxidized CHEMICAL__polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon (CHEMICAL_33848_PAH), has been found to be a potential health threat to occupational workers involved in dye manufacturing factories.
28029781	It has been observed that occupational workers become exposed to BA either during manufacturing, pulverization, or storage and developed various kinds of DISEASE_D012871_skin_diseases like DISEASE_D003877_contact_dermatitis, DISEASE_D011537_itching, erythema, roughness, and foremost, DISEASE_D017495_hyperpigmentation.
28029781	It has been shown that some environmental organic pollutants (POPs) like CHEMICAL_D004147_dioxins, CHEMICAL_D005663_furans, and CHEMICAL_D011078_polychlorinated_biphenyls (CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs) may act as ligands for the GENE_10090)_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor (GENE_10090)_AhR) and regulate DISEASE_D017495_hyperpigmentation.
28029781	Here, we hypothesized that BA may also act as a ligand for GENE_10090)_AhR and possibly regulate the melanogenic pathway to induced DISEASE_D017495_hyperpigmentation.
28029781	Our computation results indicate that BA has a high binding affinity toward GENE_10090)_AhR for the initiation of melanogenic signaling.
28029781	Following the in silico predictions, we used primary SPECIES_10090_mouse melanocytes (PMMs) and confirmed that exposure to BA (5, 10, and 25  M) resulted in an increase in GENE_10090)_AhR expression, GENE_10090)_tyrosinase activity, and melanin synthesis.
28029781	Moreover, to study the physiological relevance of these findings, C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice were topically exposed to BA, and enhanced pigmentation and melanin synthesis were observed.
28029781	Furthermore, the study was extended to assess the mechanistic aspects involved in BA-induced DISEASE_D017495_hyperpigmentation in PMMs as well as in SPECIES_10090_mouse skin.
28029781	Our results suggest that BA exposure initiates GENE_10090)_AhR signaling and increases GENE_10090)_tyrosinase enzyme activity and melanin synthesis.
28029781	Moreover, the genes that regulate the melanin synthesis, such as GENE_10090)_TRP_1, GENE_10090)_TRP_2 and the transcription factor GENE_10090)_MITF, were also found to be increased.
28029781	Thus, altogether, we suggest that BA-GENE_10090)_AhR interactions are critical for BA-induced DISEASE_D017495_hyperpigmentation.
28032951	Methanolic bark extract of Acacia catechu ameliorates CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene induced DISEASE_D008171_lung_toxicity by abrogation of oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and apoptosis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28032951	CHEMICAL_D001564_Benzo_a_pyrene [B(a)P] is a well-known carcinogen present in the environment.
28032951	In this study, we evaluated the protective potential of methanolic bark extract of Acacia catechu Willd.
28032951	(CHEMICAL__MEBA) against the DISEASE_D008171_lung_toxicity induced by CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P in Swiss albino SPECIES_10090_mice.
28032951	To determine the protective efficacy of CHEMICAL__MEBA, it was orally administered to the SPECIES_10090_mice at two doses (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 7 days.
28032951	SPECIES_10090_Mice were also exposed (orally) to CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P at a dose of 125 mg/kg body weight on 7th day.
28032951	Administration of CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P increased the activities of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity markers such as LDH, LPO, and XO with a subsequent decrease in the activities of tissue anti-oxidant armory (CAT, SOD, GST, GENE_10090)_GPx, GR, QR, and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH).
28032951	It also caused activation of the apoptotic and inflammatory pathway by upregulation of GENE_10090)_TNF_a, NF-kB, GENE_10090)_COX_2, GENE_10090)_p53, GENE_10090)_bax, GENE_10090)_caspase_3, and downregulating GENE_10090)_Bcl_2.
28032951	Pretreatment with CHEMICAL__MEBA at two different doses (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) significantly ameliorates CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P-induced increased DISEASE_D064420_toxicity markers and activities of detoxifying enzymes along with the levels of CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione content.
28032951	It also significantly attenuated expression of apoptotic and inflammatory markers in the lungs.
28032951	Histological results further confirmed the protective role of CHEMICAL__MEBA against B(a)P-induced DISEASE_D008171_lung_toxicity.
28032951	The results indicate that CHEMICAL__MEBA may be beneficial in ameliorating the B(a)P-induced oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and apoptosis in the lungs of SPECIES_10090_mice.

28031460	The Inhibitory Role of a2,6-Sialylation in Adipogenesis.
28031460	Adipose tissue plays critical roles in DISEASE_D009765_obesity and DISEASE_D004194_related_diseases such as DISEASE_D003920_diabetes and DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases.
28031460	Previous reports suggest that glycans, the most common posttranslational modifications, are involved in DISEASE_D009765_obesity_related_diseases, but what type of glycan regulates adipogenesis during DISEASE_D009765_obesity remains unclear.
28031460	In this study, we first quantified the mRNA levels of 167 genes (encoding 144 glycosyltransferases and 23 related enzymes) in visceral adipose tissues (VATs) from control SPECIES_10090_mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10090_mice.
28031460	We found that a gene encoding b-galactoside a2,6-sialyltransferase-1 (GENE_10090)_St6gal1), a key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of a2,6-linked CHEMICAL_D019158_sialic_acid in CHEMICAL__N-linked glycans, was most down-regulated in VATs from DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10090_mice.
28031460	We confirmed the reduction in CHEMICAL__a2_6_sialic_acid in VATs from DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10090_mice and differentiated adipocyte model 3T3-L1 cells.
28031460	Using proteomic analysis, integrin-b1 was identified as one of the target a2,6-sialylated proteins in adipose tissues, and phosphorylation of its downstream molecule focal adhesion kinase was found to be decreased after HFD feeding.
28031460	GENE_10090)_St6gal1 overexpression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells inhibited adipogenesis with increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase.
28031460	Furthermore, GENE_10090)_St6gal1 knockout SPECIES_10090_mice exhibited increased bodyweight and VAT weight after HFD feeding.
28031460	The down-regulation of GENE_6480_St6gal1 during adipogenesis was canceled by treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, suggesting an involvement of epigenetic DNA methylation in GENE_6480_St6gal1 silencing.
28031460	Our findings suggest that GENE_6480_ST6GAL1 has an inhibitory role in adipogenesis through integrin-b1 activation, providing new insights into the roles and regulation mechanisms of glycans in adipocytes during DISEASE_D009765_obesity.
28034800	Effects of CHEMICAL_C017953_tetramethylpyrazine from Chinese black vinegar on antioxidant and DISEASE_C565732_hypolipidemia activities in HepG2 cells.
28034800	CHEMICAL_C017953_Tetramethylpyrazine is a bioactive compound found in Chinese black vinegar.
28034800	This work is to investigate the potential effects of CHEMICAL_C017953_tetramethylpyrazine on intracellular CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol modulation in HepG2 cells.
28034800	The results demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C017953_tetramethylpyrazine can induce intracellular CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol efflux.
28034800	CHEMICAL_C017953_Tetramethylpyrazine may also improve endothelial function through its antioxidant effects by inhibiting reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species levels and increasing the antioxidant enzymes CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase and GENE_847_catalase.
28034800	CHEMICAL_C017953_Tetramethylpyrazine increased liver X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gene expression in HepG2 cells.
28034800	Protein expression of CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 was up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner (P  <  0.05).
28034800	The biological significance of CHEMICAL_C017953_tetramethylpyrazine may involve hypolipidemic effects via modulation of intracellular CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol efflux, ROS inhibition, increases in SOD and CAT activities, and direct regulation of GENE_5465_PPAR and LXR gene expression.
28034800	CHEMICAL_C017953_Tetramethylpyrazine may improve lipid profiles by elevating the PPARy-LXRa-GENE_19_ABCA1 pathway.
28040552	Chemoprotective role of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin in CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced toxicity along the brain-pituitary-testicular axis in rats.
28040552	Reproductive dysfunction in response to CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese exposure has been reported in humans and animals.
28040552	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin, a bioflavonoid widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and beverages has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities in different experimental model systems.
28040552	However, there is dearth of scientific information on the influence of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin on CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced reproductive toxicity.
28040552	This study was designed to evaluate the influence of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin on CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced functional alterations along the brain-pituitary- testicular axis in rats.
28040552	CHEMICAL_D008345_Manganese was administered alone at 15  mg/kg body weight or orally co-treated with CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin at 10 and 20  mg/kg body weight for 45 consecutive days.
28040552	Results indicated that CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin co-treatment significantly (p  <  0.05) inhibited CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced elevation in biomarkers of oxidative stress whereas it increased antioxidant enzymes activities and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione level in the brain, testes and epididymis of the treated rats.
28040552	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin mediated suppression of inflammatory indices and caspase-3 activity was accompanied by preservation of histo-architectures of the brain, testes and epididymis in CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-treated rats.
28040552	The significant reversal of CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced decreases in reproductive hormones (i.e.
28040552	luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone) and testicular activities of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase by CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin was complemented by an increase in sperm quality and quantity in the treated rats.
28040552	Collectively, CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin modulated CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced toxicity along the brain-pituitary-testicular axis in rats via its intrinsic antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, and may thus represent a potential pharmacological agent against CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced male reproductive deficits in humans.

28041982	The estrogenic chemical CHEMICAL_C041594_4_nonylphenol (NP) is known to impair testicular devolopment and spermatogenesis in rodents.
28041982	The objective of this study was to explore the effects of NP on autophagy induction and AMPK-GENE_10116)_mTOR signaling pathway in Sertoli cells (SCs), which are the "nursemaid cells" for meiosis of spermatocytes.
28041982	In this study we exposed 7-week-old male SPECIES_10116_rats to NP by intra-peritoneal injection at 0, 20, 50 or 100mg/kg body weight/2days for 20 consecutive days.
28041982	Our results showed that exposure to NP dose-dependently induces the formation of autophagosomes in SCs, increases the expression of GENE_10116)_Beclin_1, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the mRNA expression of GENE_10116)_Atg3, GENE_10116)_Atg5, GENE_10116)_Atg7 and GENE_10116)_Atg12 in testis, and these effects are concomitant with the activation of AMPK, and the suppression of GENE_10116)_TSC2-GENE_10116)_mTOR-p70S6K/4EBP1 signaling cascade in testis.
28041982	Furthermore, 10 M Compound C or AMPKa1 siRNA pre-treatment effectively attenuated autophagy and reversed AMPK-GENE_10116)_mTOR-p70S6K/4EBP1 signaling in NP-treated SCs.
28041982	Co-treatment with 1mM AICAR remarkably strengthened NP-induced autophagy and GENE_10116)_mTOR inhibition in SCs.
28041982	Together, these data suggest that NP stimulates Sertoli cell autophagy and inhibits GENE_10116)_mTOR-p70S6K/4EBP1 activity through AMPK activation, which is the potential mechanism responsible for the regulation of testis function and differentiation following NP exposure.
28049043	CHEMICAL__Perfluoroalkyl_acids-induced DISEASE_D005234_liver_steatosis: Effects on genes controlling lipid homeostasis.
28049043	Persistent presence of CHEMICAL__perfluoroalkyl_acids (CHEMICAL__PFAAs) in the environment is due to their extensive use in industrial and consumer products, and their slow decay.
28049043	Biochemical tests in SPECIES_10116_rodent demonstrated that these chemicals are potent modifiers of lipid metabolism and cause hepatocellular DISEASE_D005234_steatosis.
28049043	However, the molecular mechanism of CHEMICAL__PFAAs interference with lipid metabolism remains to be elucidated.
28049043	Currently, two major hypotheses are that CHEMICAL__PFAAs interfere with mitochondrial beta-oxidation of CHEMICAL_D005227_fatty_acids and/or they affect the transcriptional activity of GENE_5465_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_a (GENE_5465_PPARa) in liver.
28049043	To determine the ability of structurally-diverse CHEMICAL__PFAAs to cause DISEASE_D005234_steatosis, as well as to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, DISEASE_D017827_wild_type (DISEASE_D017827_WT) and GENE_10090)_PPARa-null SPECIES_10090_mice were treated with CHEMICAL_C023036_perfluorooctanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA), CHEMICAL_C584865_perfluorononanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA), or CHEMICAL_C471071_perfluorohexane_sulfonate (CHEMICAL__PFHxS), by oral gavage for 7days, and their effects were compared to that of GENE_10090)_PPARa agonist CHEMICAL_C006253_WY_14643 (WY), which does not cause DISEASE_D005234_steatosis.
28049043	Increases in liver weight and cell size, and decreases in DNA content per mg of liver, were observed for all compounds in DISEASE_D017827_WT SPECIES_10090_mice, and were also seen in GENE_10090)_PPARa-null SPECIES_10090_mice for CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA, CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA, and CHEMICAL__PFHxS, but not for WY.
28049043	In CHEMICAL_C011049_Oil_Red_O stained sections, DISEASE_D017827_WT liver showed increased lipid accumulation in all treatment groups, whereas in GENE_10090)_PPARa-null livers, accumulation was observed after CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA and CHEMICAL__PFHxS treatment, adding to the burden of DISEASE_D005234_steatosis observed in control (untreated) GENE_10090)_PPARa-null SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049043	Liver CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride (TG) levels were elevated in DISEASE_D017827_WT SPECIES_10090_mice by all CHEMICAL__PFAAs and in GENE_10090)_PPARa-null SPECIES_10090_mice only by CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA.
28049043	In vitro b-oxidation of CHEMICAL_D010172_palmitoyl_carnitine by isolated SPECIES_10116_rat liver mitochondria was not inhibited by any of the 7 CHEMICAL__PFAAs tested.
28049043	Likewise, neither CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA nor CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS inhibited CHEMICAL_7896_palmitate oxidation by HepG2/C3A SPECIES_9606_human liver cell cultures.
28049043	Microarray analysis of livers from CHEMICAL__PFAAs-treated SPECIES_10090_mice indicated that the CHEMICAL__PFAAs induce the expression of the lipid catabolism genes, as well as those involved in CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid and CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride synthesis, in DISEASE_D017827_WT SPECIES_10090_mice and, to a lesser extent, in GENE_10090)_PPARa-null SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049043	These results indicate that most of the CHEMICAL__PFAAs increase liver TG load and promote DISEASE_D005234_steatosis in SPECIES_10090_mice We hypothesize that CHEMICAL__PFAAs increase DISEASE_D005234_steatosis because the balance of CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid accumulation/synthesis and oxidation is disrupted to favor accumulation.
28049044	Lymphocytes contribute to DISEASE_D014947_biliary_injury and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in experimental xenobiotic-induced DISEASE_D002779_cholestasis.
28049044	The etiology of chronic DISEASE_D001649_bile_duct_injury and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in SPECIES_9606_patients with autoimmune cholestatic DISEASE_D008107_liver_diseases is complex, and likely involves immune cells such as lymphocytes.
28049044	However, most models of DISEASE_D005355_biliary_fibrosis are not autoimmune in nature.
28049044	DISEASE_D005355_Biliary_fibrosis can be induced experimentally by prolonged exposure of SPECIES_10090_mice to the bile duct toxicant CHEMICAL_D015058_alpha_naphthylisothiocyanate (CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT).
28049044	We determined whether lymphocytes contributed to CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-mediated DISEASE_D006965_biliary_hyperplasia and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049044	Hepatic accumulation of T-lymphocytes and increased serum levels of anti-nuclear-autoantibodies were evident in wild-type SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT (0.05% CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT in chow).
28049044	This occurred alongside DISEASE_D001649_bile_duct_hyperplasia and DISEASE_D005355_biliary_fibrosis.
28049044	To assess the role of lymphocytes in CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-induced DISEASE_D005355_biliary_fibrosis, we utilized GENE_10090)_RAG1-/- SPECIES_10090_mice, which lack T- and B-lymphocytes.
28049044	CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-induced DISEASE_D001649_bile_duct_injury, indicated by increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity, was reduced in CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-exposed GENE_10090)_RAG1-/- SPECIES_10090_mice compared to CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-exposed wild-type SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049044	Despite this reduction in DISEASE_D014947_biliary_injury, CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-induced DISEASE_D001649_bile_duct_hyperplasia was similar in wild-type and GENE_10090)_RAG1-/- SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049044	However, hepatic induction of profibrogenic genes including GENE_10090)_COL1A1, GENE_10090)_ITGb6 and GENE_10090)_TGFb2 was markedly attenuated in CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-exposed GENE_10090)_RAG1-/- SPECIES_10090_mice compared to CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-exposed wild-type SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049044	Peribiliary collagen deposition was also reduced in CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-exposed GENE_10090)_RAG1-/- SPECIES_10090_mice.
28049044	The results indicate that lymphocytes exacerbate DISEASE_D001649_bile_duct_injury and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice without impacting DISEASE_D001649_bile_duct_hyperplasia.
28049045	In vitro models reveal differences in the developmental DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity of an environmental CHEMICAL__polycylic_aromatic_hydrocarbon mixture compared to CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene: Neuronotypic PC12 Cells and embryonic neural stem cells.
28049045	In addition to their carcinogenic activity, CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons (CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs) are suspected to be developmental neurotoxicants.
28049045	We evaluated the effects of CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs with two in vitro models that assess distinct "decision nodes" in neurodifferentiation: neuronotypic PC12 cells, which characterize the transition from cell replication to neurodifferentiation, DISEASE_D058225_neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter specification; and embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs), which evaluate the origination of neurons and glia from precursors.
28049045	We compared an environmentally-derived CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixture from a Superfund contamination site (Elizabeth River Sediment Extract, ERSE) to those of a single CHEMICAL_33848_PAH, CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (GENE_11331_BaP).
28049045	In PC12 cells, GENE_10116)_BaP impaired the transition from cell replication to neurodifferentiation, resulting in higher numbers of cells, but with reduced cell size and deficits in all indices of neuronal features (DISEASE_D058225_neurite formation, development of CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine and CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine phenotypes).
28049045	ERSE was far less effective, causing only modest changes in cell numbers and size and no impairment of DISEASE_D058225_neurite formation or neurotransmitter specification; in fact, ERSE evoked a slight increase in emergence of the CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine phenotype.
28049045	In the NSC model, this relationship was entirely reversed, with far greater sensitivity to ERSE than to GENE_11331_BaP.
28049045	Furthermore, ERSE, but not GENE_11331_BaP, enhanced NSC differentiation into neurons, whereas both ERSE and GENE_11331_BaP suppressed the glial phenotype.
28049045	Our studies provide a cause-and-effect relationship for the observed association of developmental CHEMICAL_33848_PAH exposure to DISEASE_D001523_behavioral_deficits.
28049045	Further, CHEMICAL_33848_PAH sensitivity occurs over developmental stages corresponding to rudimentary brain formation through terminal neurodifferentiation, suggesting that vulnerability likely extends throughout fetal brain development and into early childhood.
28054265	Assessment of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide in the heart of SPECIES_9031_Gallus_gallus: alterations of oxidative damage parameters, inflammatory cytokines, and cardiac enzymes.
28054265	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3) in the SPECIES_9031_chicken heart, and 72 1-day-old male Hy-line SPECIES_9031_chickens were fed either a commercial diet (C group) or an CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic supplement diet containing 7.5  mg/kg (L group), 15  mg/kg (M group), or 30  mg/kg (H group) CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 for 90  days.
28054265	The results showed that exposure to CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 merely lowered (P  <  0.05) the activities of catalase (CAT) and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-Px) in M and H groups at 90  days, significantly downregulated the inhibition ability of CHEMICAL_D017665_hydroxyl radicals (OH  ), and upregulated (P  <  0.05) the contents of CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) in CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure groups at 30, 60, and 90  days.
28054265	Meanwhile, the messenger RNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), GENE_9031)_cyclooxygenase_2 (GENE_9031)_COX_2), GENE_9031)_inducible_nitric_oxide_synthase (GENE_9031)_iNOS), and GENE_9031)_prostaglandin_E_synthase (GENE_9031)_PTGEs)) significantly increased (P  <  0.05) in CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure groups at 30, 60, and 90  days, and histological and ultrastructural damage was observed in CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure groups.
28054265	Additionally, CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3-induced cardiac enzyme (CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate transaminase (AST), CHEMICAL_D003401_creatine kinase (CK), CHEMICAL_D003401_creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CHEMICAL__a_hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (a-HBDH)) levels increased (P  <  0.05) at 90  days.
28054265	These findings suggested that CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure led to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and histological and ultrastructural damage and altered the levels of cardiac enzymes in SPECIES_9031_chicken heart tissues.
28054265	This result may be helpful for further studies on the toxicological mechanisms of CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 in the SPECIES_9031_chicken heart.
28053092	GENE_2033_Histone_Acetyltransferase_p300/CREB-binding Protein-associated Factor (GENE_8850_PCAF) Is Required for CHEMICAL__All_i_trans_i_retinoic_Acid-induced Granulocytic Differentiation in DISEASE_D007938_Leukemia Cells.
28053092	Differentiation therapy with CHEMICAL__all_i_trans_i_retinoic_acid (CHEMICAL__ATRA) improves the treatment outcome of DISEASE_D015473_acute_promyelocytic_leukemia (DISEASE_D015473_APL); however, the molecular mechanism by which CHEMICAL__ATRA induces granulocytic differentiation remains unclear.
28053092	We previously reported that the inhibition of the CHEMICAL_D009243_NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) GENE_22933_SIRT2 induces granulocytic differentiation in DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells, suggesting the involvement of protein acetylation in CHEMICAL__ATRA-induced DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cell differentiation.
28053092	Herein, we show that GENE_2033_p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (GENE_8850_PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), is a prerequisite for CHEMICAL__ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells.
28053092	We found that GENE_8850_PCAF expression was markedly DISEASE_D007938_increased_in_leukemia cell lines (SPECIES_9606_NB4 and HL-60) and primary DISEASE_D015473_APL cells during CHEMICAL__ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation.
28053092	Consistent with these results, the expression of GENE_8850_PCAF was markedly up-regulated in the bone marrow cells of DISEASE_D015473_APL SPECIES_9606_patients who received CHEMICAL__ATRA-containing chemotherapy.
28053092	The knockdown of GENE_8850_PCAF inhibited CHEMICAL__ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cell lines and primary DISEASE_D015473_APL cells.
28053092	Conversely, the overexpression of GENE_8850_PCAF induced the expression of the granulocytic differentiation marker GENE_3684_CD11b at the mRNA level.
28053092	Acetylome analysis identified the acetylated proteins after CHEMICAL__ATRA treatment, and we found that histone H3, a known GENE_8850_PCAF acetylation substrate, was preferentially acetylated by the CHEMICAL__ATRA treatment.
28053092	Furthermore, we have demonstrated that GENE_8850_PCAF is required for the acetylation of histone H3 on the promoter of CHEMICAL__ATRA target genes, such as<i>GENE_6347_CCL2</i>and<i>GENE_2268_FGR</i>, and for the expression of these genes in CHEMICAL__ATRA-treated DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells.
28053092	These results strongly support our hypothesis that GENE_8850_PCAF is induced and activated by CHEMICAL__ATRA, and the subsequent acetylation of GENE_8850_PCAF substrates promotes granulocytic differentiation in DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells.
28053092	Targeting GENE_8850_PCAF and its downstream acetylation targets could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome all subtypes of DISEASE_D015470_AML.
28058446	Hepatotoxic effects of CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole and CHEMICAL_C045362_prochloraz in wild-type and GENE_1525_hCAR/GENE_8856_hPXR SPECIES_10090_mice.
28058446	The agricultural fungicides CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole and CHEMICAL_C045362_prochloraz exhibit hepatotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_rodent studies and are tumorigenic following chronic exposure.
28058446	Both substances are suspected to act via a GENE_10090)_CAR_constitutive_androstane_receptor)/GENE_10090)_PXR (GENE_10090)_pregnane_X_receptor)-dependent mechanism.
28058446	SPECIES_9606_Human relevance of these findings is under debate.
28058446	A 28-day DISEASE_D064420_toxicity study was conducted in SPECIES_10090_mice with humanized GENE_10090)_CAR and GENE_10090)_PXR (GENE_1525_hCAR/GENE_8856_hPXR) with two dose levels (50 or 500  ppm) of both substances, using the model GENE_10090)_CAR activator CHEMICAL_D010634_phenobarbital as a reference.
28058446	Results were compared to wild-type SPECIES_10090_mice.
28058446	A treatment-related increase in liver weights was observed for all three substances at least at the high-dose level.
28058446	Changes in the expression of classic GENE_10090)_CAR/GENE_10090)_PXR target genes such as GENE_10090)_Cyp2b10 were induced by CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole and CHEMICAL_D010634_phenobarbital in both genotypes, while CHEMICAL_C045362_prochloraz treatment resulted in gene expression changes indicative of additional CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor activation, e.g.
28058446	by up-regulation of GENE_10090)_Cyp1a1 expression.
28058446	CHEMICAL_C093628_Cyproconazole-induced effects on GENE_10090)_CAR-dependent gene expression, liver weight, and DISEASE_D008107_hepatic_lipid_accumulation were more prominent in wild-type SPECIES_10090_mice, where significant genotype differences were observed at the high-dose level.
28058446	Moreover, high-dose CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole-treated SPECIES_10090_mice from the wild-type group responded with a marked increase in hepatocellular proliferation, while GENE_1525_hCAR/GENE_8856_hPXR SPECIES_10090_mice did not.
28058446	In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole and PB induce GENE_10090)_CAR/GENE_10090)_PXR downstream effects in hepatocytes in vivo via both, the SPECIES_10090_murine and SPECIES_9606_human receptors.
28058446	At high doses of CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole, however, the responses were clearly more pronounced in wild-type SPECIES_10090_mice, indicating increased sensitivity of rodents to GENE_10090)_CAR agonist-induced effects in hepatocytes.
28062356	GENE_8529_CYP4F2 repression and a modified CHEMICAL_D024502_alpha_tocopherol (CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E) metabolism are two independent consequences of CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes.
28062356	The expression of GENE_8529_CYP4F2, a form of cytochrome P-450 with proposed role in CHEMICAL__a_tocopherol and long-chain CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid metabolism, was explored in HepG2 and HepaRG SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes during CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28062356	DISEASE_D064420_Cytotoxicity, ROS production, and GENE_5599_JNK and GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 kinase signaling increased in a dose and time-dependent manner during CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol treatments; GENE_8529_CYP4F2 gene expression decreased, while other CYP4F forms, namely 4F11 and 12, increased along with 3A4 and 2E1 isoforms.
28062356	CHEMICAL__a_Tocopherol antagonized the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and GENE_8529_CYP4F2 gene repression effect of CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol in HepG2 cells.
28062356	CHEMICAL_D000431_Ethanol stimulated the CHEMICAL_D024505_tocopherol-  -hydroxylase activity and the other steps of CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E metabolism, which points to a minor role of GENE_8529_CYP4F2 in this metabolism of SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes.
28062356	GENE_5468_PPAR_y and GENE_6720_SREBP_1c followed the same expression pattern of GENE_8529_CYP4F2 in response to CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol and CHEMICAL__a_tocopherol treatments.
28062356	Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of GENE_5465_PPAR-y synergized with CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol in decreasing GENE_8529_CYP4F2 protein expression, which suggests a role of this nuclear receptor in GENE_8529_CYP4F2 transcriptional regulation.
28062356	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol DISEASE_D064420_toxicity modifies the CYP expression pattern of SPECIES_9606_human hepatic cells impairing GENE_8529_CYP4F2 transcription and protein expression.
28062356	These changes were associated with a lowered expression of the CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid biosynthesis regulators GENE_5468_PPAR_y and GENE_6720_SREBP_1c, and with an increased enzymatic catabolism of CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E.
28062356	GENE_8529_CYP4F2 gene repression and a sustained CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E metabolism appear to be independent effects of CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes.
28062358	Alterations in transcription and protein expressions of DISEASE_D006528_HCC-related genes in HepG2 cells caused by CHEMICAL_C057862_microcystin_LR.
28062358	CHEMICAL_C057862_Microcystin_LR (CHEMICAL__MC_LR) is the most common and toxic hepatotoxin and it could induce SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D056486_hepatitis and DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC) via the route of drinking water.
28062358	The aim of the present study was to determine the expressions of oncogenes GENE_2353_c_fos, GENE_3725_c_jun, GENE_4609_c_myc, GENE_4233_c_met, and CHEMICAL__N-ras and DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor gene GENE_5728_PTEN in HepG2 cells following CHEMICAL__MC_LR-exposure to understand the possible mechanism of CHEMICAL__MC_LR-related SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D008113_primary_liver_cancer.
28062358	The results of qPCR and Western blotting showed that CHEMICAL__MC_LR-exposure at non- or sub-cytotoxic concentrations promoted the expressions of oncogenes GENE_2353_c_fos, GENE_3725_c_jun, GENE_4609_c_myc, GENE_4233_c_met, and GENE_4893_N_ras while suppressed DISEASE_D009369_tumor-suppressor gene GENE_5728_PTEN in HepG2 cells at both transcription and protein levels.
28062358	This result suggests that DISEASE_D006528_HCC-related genes may be involved in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D056486_hepatitis and DISEASE_D008113_primary_liver_cancer caused by CHEMICAL__MC_LR.
28062358	The work might be useful for evaluating the SPECIES_9606_human health risk resulted from the long-term of CHEMICAL__MC_LR-exposure at low dose via drinking water route.
28063906	CHEMICAL_D011718_Pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity is alleviated by 4-PBA via inhibition of the GENE_9451_PERK-GENE_1965_eIF2a-GENE_468_ATF4-GENE_1649_CHOP pathway.
28063906	CHEMICAL_D011718_Pyrazinamide (CHEMICAL__PZA)-induced serious DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury, but the exact mechanism of CHEMICAL__PZA-induces hepatotoxicity remains controversial.
28063906	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-caused cell apoptosis plays a critical role in the development of DISEASE_D056486_drug_induced_liver_injury (DISEASE_D056486_DILI).
28063906	However, the direct connection between CHEMICAL__PZA DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and ER stress is unknown.
28063906	In this study, we describe the role of ER stress in CHEMICAL__PZA induced hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro.
28063906	We found that CHEMICAL__PZA induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells, and causes DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage in SPECIES_10116_rats, characterized by increased serum ALT, AST and CHEMICAL__TBA levels.
28063906	CHEMICAL__PZA impairs antioxidant defenses, although this effect did not play an important role in resulting DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28063906	The ER stress related proteins GENE_3309_GRP78, p-GENE_9451_PERK, p-GENE_1965_eIF2a, GENE_468_ATF4, GENE_1649_CHOP and caspase12 were activated after CHEMICAL__PZA exposure both in vivo and in vitro.
28063906	Furthermore, as an ER stress inhibitor, CHEMICAL_C075773_sodium_4_phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) could ameliorate CHEMICAL__PZA DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in HepG2 cells and SPECIES_10116_rat liver.
28063906	These results have potential implications for the pathogenesis of CHEMICAL__PZA-induced hepatotoxicity in which ER stress especially GENE_9451_PERK-GENE_1965_eIF2a-GENE_468_ATF4-GENE_1649_CHOP pathway participates in DISEASE_D056486_hepatocellular_injury.
28067909	GENE_23347_SMCHD1 mutations associated with a rare DISEASE_D009136_muscular_dystrophy can also cause DISEASE_C537429_isolated_arhinia and DISEASE_C537429_Bosma_arhinia_microphthalmia_syndrome.
28067909	DISEASE_C537429_Arhinia, or absence of the nose, is a rare DISEASE_D000014_malformation of unknown etiology that is often accompanied by DISEASE_D005124_ocular_and_reproductive_defects.
28067909	Sequencing of 40 SPECIES_9606_people with DISEASE_C537429_arhinia revealed that 84% of probands harbor a missense mutation localized to a constrained region of GENE_23347_SMCHD1 encompassing the ATPase domain.
28067909	GENE_23347_SMCHD1 mutations cause DISEASE_D009136_facioscapulohumeral_muscular_dystrophy_type_2 (DISEASE_D009136_FSHD2) via a trans-acting loss-of-function epigenetic mechanism.
28067909	We discovered shared mutations and comparable DNA hypomethylation patterning between these distinct disorders.
28067909	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated alteration of GENE_7955)_smchd1 in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish yielded DISEASE_C537429_arhinia-relevant phenotypes.
28067909	Transcriptome and protein analyses in DISEASE_C537429_arhinia probands and controls showed no differences in GENE_23347_SMCHD1 mRNA or protein abundance but revealed regulatory changes in genes and pathways associated with craniofacial patterning.
28067909	Mutations in GENE_23347_SMCHD1 thus contribute to distinct phenotypic spectra, from craniofacial DISEASE_D025063_malformation_and_reproductive_disorders to DISEASE_D009136_muscular_dystrophy, which we speculate to be consistent with oligogenic mechanisms resulting in pleiotropic outcomes.
28063877	GENE_23643_Myeloid_differentiation_protein_2-dependent mechanisms in DISEASE_D015427_retinal_ischemia_reperfusion_injury.
28063877	DISEASE_D012173_Retinal_ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathological process in DISEASE_D005124_many_eye_disorders.
28063877	Oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation play a role in retinal I/R injury.
28063877	Recent studies show that GENE_7099_toll_like_receptor_4 (GENE_7099_TLR4) is involved in initiating sterile inflammatory response in retinal I/R.
28063877	However, the molecular mechanism by which GENE_7099_TLR4 is activated is not known.
28063877	In this study, we show that retinal I/R injury involves a co-receptor of GENE_7099_TLR4, myeloid differentiation 2 (GENE_23643_MD2).
28063877	Inhibition of GENE_23643_MD2 prevented cell death and preserved retinal function following retinal I/R injury.
28063877	We confirmed these findings using GENE_10090)_MD2 knockout SPECIES_10090_mice.
28063877	Furthermore, we utilized SPECIES_9606_human retinal pigment epithelial cells (SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19 cells) to show that oxidative stress-induced cell death as well as inflammatory response are mediated through GENE_23643_MD2.
28063877	Inhibition of GENE_23643_MD2 through a chemical inhibitor or knockdown prevented oxidative stress-induced cell death and expression of inflammatory cytokines.
28063877	Oxidative stress was found to activate GENE_7099_TLR4 in a GENE_23643_MD2-dependent manner via increasing the expression of GENE_3146_high_mobility_group_box_1.
28063877	In summary, our study shows that oxidative stress in retinal I/R injury can activate GENE_7099_TLR4 signaling via GENE_23643_MD2, resulting in induction of inflammatory genes and DISEASE_D012164_retinal_damage.
28063877	GENE_23643_MD2 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for retinal I/R injury.
28065758	CHEMICAL_D014810_Vitamin_E reduces CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan-induced toxic effects on morphology and behavior in early development of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio).
28065758	The aim of this study was to investigate if CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E (CHEMICAL__a_TOC) modulates the developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of the pesticide CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan (CHEMICAL__ESF), using a modified SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET).
28065758	SPECIES_7955_Zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) embryos were exposed from 6 to 72  h post fertilization (hpf) to either CHEMICAL__ESF (0.1-50  mg/L) or CHEMICAL__a_TOC (0.01-3  mM) alone or in combination.
28065758	The effects of these exposures on embryonic morphology, larval behavior and antioxidant gene expression were analyzed.
28065758	Phenotypic analysis at 48 hpf showed that CHEMICAL__ESF led to a dose-dependent DISEASE_D009140_increase_in_embryonic_deformities, including DISEASE_D000014_axis_malformations, pericardial DISEASE_D004487_edema and DISEASE_D010859_reduced_pigmentation.
28065758	Co-exposure of CHEMICAL__ESF with CHEMICAL__a_TOC (1-3  mM) significantly (p  <  0.05) reduced CHEMICAL__ESF-induced DISEASE_D000014_embryonic_malformations.
28065758	Exposure to solely CHEMICAL__a_TOC did not affect rates of survival or DISEASE_D000014_malformations.
28065758	Behavior studies showed that CHEMICAL__ESF caused DISEASE_D006948_hyperactivity at 5 days post fertilization, indicating a developmental DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxic effect.
28065758	The CHEMICAL__ESF-induced DISEASE_D006948_hyperactivity was ameliorated by CHEMICAL__a_TOC.
28065758	Elevated CHEMICAL__ESF concentrations caused down-regulation of the antioxidant genes cuzn-sod, GENE_7955)_gpx1a and cat, suggesting that CHEMICAL__ESF promoted oxidative stress in the embryos.
28065758	CHEMICAL__a_TOC did not prevent the CHEMICAL__ESF-induced dysregulation of these genes.
28065758	These results demonstrate that CHEMICAL__a_TOC protects against phenotypic and behavioral effects caused by CHEMICAL__ESF but did not rescue CHEMICAL__ESF-induced aberrations in antioxidant gene expression.
28065790	Comparison of cellular and transcriptomic effects between electronic cigarette vapor and cigarette smoke in SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells.
28065790	UNASSIGNED: The use of electronic cigarette (e-cig) can be considered as an alternative to smoking.
28065790	However, due to a lack of thorough toxicological studies, absolute safety of these products cannot be guaranteed.
28065790	The aim of this in vitro work was to investigate the potential DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of e-vapors generated by a smoking machine in SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells cultured at air-liquid interface, in comparison to cigarette smoke (CS).
28065790	Although CS decreased strongly cell viability from 48min exposure, e-vapors induced no DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity up to 288min exposure.
28065790	Moreover, oxidative stress was evidenced only after exposure to CS, with a decrease secretion of GRO- - from 8min and of GENE_3576_IL_8 and GENE_6347_MCP_1 after 48min exposure.
28065790	Only a low increase of GENE_3569_IL_6 secretion was measured in cells exposed to e-vapors.
28065790	Finally, transcriptomic data of exposed cells indicated that a large number of genes were deregulated in response to CS, especially genes involved in important biological functions as oxidative stress and cell death, while e-vapors elicited very discrete modulation.
28065790	These results strongly suggest a lower DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of e-vapors compared to CS in the BEAS-2B cell line and constitute a baseline for further experimental studies with a larger spectrum of e-liquids and e-cig models.
28067911	De novo mutations in SMCHD1 cause DISEASE_C537429_Bosma_arhinia_microphthalmia_syndrome and abrogate nasal development.
28067911	DISEASE_C537429_Bosma_arhinia_microphthalmia_syndrome (DISEASE_C537429_BAMS) is an extremely rare and striking condition characterized by complete absence of the nose with or without DISEASE_D005124_ocular_defects.
28067911	We report here that missense mutations in the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 mapping to the extended ATPase domain of the encoded protein cause DISEASE_C537429_BAMS in all 14 cases studied.
28067911	All mutations were de novo where parental DNA was available.
28067911	Biochemical tests and in vivo assays in Xenopus laevis embryos suggest that these mutations may behave as gain-of-function alleles.
28067911	This finding is in contrast to the loss-of-function mutations in SMCHD1 that have been associated with DISEASE_D009136_facioscapulohumeral_muscular_dystrophy (DISEASE_D009136_FSHD) type 2.
28067911	Our results establish SMCHD1 as a key player in nasal development and provide biochemical insight into its enzymatic function that may be exploited for development of therapeutics for DISEASE_D009136_FSHD.
28070110	CHEMICAL_D008550_Melatonin suppresses CHEMICAL_D008694_methamphetamine-triggered DISEASE_D015775_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress in DISEASE_C567307_C6_cells_glioma cell lines.
28070110	CHEMICAL_D008694_Methamphetamine (CHEMICAL_D008694_METH) is a DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxic drug that causes DISEASE_D001927_brain_damage by inducing neuronal and DISEASE_D004194_glial_cell_death together with glial cell hyperactivity-mediated progressive DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration.
28070110	Previous studies have shown that CHEMICAL_D008694_METH induced DISEASE_D004194_glial_cell_hyperactivity_and_death via oxidative stress, the inflammatory response, and DISEASE_D015775_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress (DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress) mechanisms, and CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin could reverse these effects.
28070110	However, the exact mechanism of the protective role of CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin in CHEMICAL_D008694_METH-mediated DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress has not been understood.
28070110	This study investigated the protective effect of CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin against CHEMICAL_D008694_METH DISEASE_D064420_toxicity-mediated DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress in glial cells.
28070110	Our study demonstrated that CHEMICAL_D008694_METH increased DISEASE_D004194_glial_cell_toxicity related to CHEMICAL_D008694_METH-induced DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress by stimulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) to activate the expression of DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress transducers, including phosphorylated double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (p-GENE_9451_PERK), activating transcription factor (GENE_22926_ATF6), and phosphorylated CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (p-IRE1).
28070110	Moreover, the expression of GENE_3309_binding_immunoglobulin_protein (GENE_3309_Bip), GENE_1649_CCAAT_enhancer_binding_protein_homologous_protein (GENE_1649_CHOP), caspase-12, phosphorylated GENE_83939_eukaryotic_translation_initiation_factor_2_alpha (p-GENE_1965_eIF2a) and spliced GENE_7494_X_box_binding_protein_1 (GENE_7494_XBP_1) mRNA were also increased.
28070110	CHEMICAL_D008550_Melatonin reduced DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress induced by CHEMICAL_D008694_METH DISEASE_D064420_toxicity by reducing the expression of DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress response genes and proteins in a concentration-dependent manner.
28070110	In addition, CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin promoted the expression of GENE_3309_Bip chaperone in a concentration-dependent manner.
28070110	Taken together, our findings suggest that CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin can protect against DISEASE_D015775_ER_stress-induced DISEASE_D004194_glial_cell_death induced by CHEMICAL_D008694_METH.
28069986	Mechanisms Involved in Porcine Early SPECIES_6239_Embryo Survival following CHEMICAL_D000431_Ethanol Exposure.
28069986	CHEMICAL_D000431_Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is still a cause of preventable DISEASE_D000014_birth_defects and DISEASE_D009069_developmental_disabilities.
28069986	However, little is known about the impact of CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol on preimplantation SPECIES_6239_embryos and the molecular mechanisms involved.
28069986	We aimed to determine the toxicogenomic impacts and the mechanisms involved in preimplantation embryonic survival following 0.2% CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol exposure in porcine SPECIES_6239_embryos.
28069986	Gene expression changes were measured with a porcine SPECIES_6239_embryo specific microarray and confirmed by RT-qPCR.
28069986	When compared with control, CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol exposure led to a 43% decrease in blastocyst rate and activated pathways associated with oxidative stress and nervous system damage, such as GENE_7157_TP53 and TGF.
28069986	Moreover, we observed a DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction in the exposed SPECIES_6239_embryos as revealed by the decrease in Mitotracker Red fluorescence intensity (25 and 41% in 4-cell SPECIES_6239_embryos and blastocysts, respectively) and a modification in the expression of GABRB3, APP, CLU, and MIOX genes.
28069986	We therefore present evidence of neuronal-like adverse effects on undifferentiated cells suggesting that fetal CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol spectrum disorder could have its origin as early as in the first week postfertilization.
28070105	CHEMICAL__a_Lipoic_acid potentially targets CHEMICAL_D000667_AMP-activated protein kinase and energy production in the fetal brain to ameliorate CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin-produced attenuation in fetal steroidogenesis.
28070105	Our previous studies demonstrated that treating pregnant SPECIES_10116_rats with CHEMICAL_D004147_dioxins, including CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD), targets the pituitary expression of luteinizing hormone (LH) to attenuate testicular steroidogenesis in fetuses, resulting in the imprinting of DISEASE_D020018_sexual_immaturity of the offspring after reaching maturity.
28070105	Furthermore, we found that although CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD disturbs the CHEMICAL_27093_tricarboxylic_acid (CHEMICAL_30956_TCA) cycle in the fetal hypothalamus, maternal co-treatment with CHEMICAL__a_lipoic_acid (CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA), a cofactor of the CHEMICAL_30956_TCA cycle, restores a CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-produced reduction in the LH-evoked steroidogenesis as well as the CHEMICAL_30956_TCA cycle activity in fetuses.
28070105	However, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA remains to be fully elucidated.
28070105	To address this issue, we compared the effect of CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA with that of CHEMICAL_D013831_thiamine, another cofactor of the CHEMICAL_30956_TCA cycle.
28070105	As with CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA, supplying CHEMICAL_D013831_thiamine to dams exposed to CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD alleviates the reduced level of not only hypothalamic CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP but also pituitary LH and testicular steroidogenic protein in fetuses.
28070105	However, CHEMICAL_D013831_thiamine had a much weaker effect than CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA.
28070105	In agreement with CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP attenuation, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD activated CHEMICAL_D000667_AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of LH production, whereas the supplementation of CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA allowed recovery from this defect.
28070105	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA restored the CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-produced reduction in the pituitary expression of the receptor for CHEMICAL_D007987_gonadotropin_releasing_hormone (CHEMICAL_D007987_GnRH), an upstream regulator of LH synthesis.
28070105	These results suggest that CHEMICAL_27432_a_LA rescues CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-produced attenuation during fetal steroidogenesis due not only to facilitation of energy production through the CHEMICAL_30956_TCA cycle but also through suppression of AMPK activation, and the pituitary CHEMICAL_D007987_GnRH receptor may serve as a mediator of these effects.
28070108	Pathway of CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD-induced apoptosis in SPECIES_9606_human embryonic kidney cells.
28070108	CHEMICAL_18721_3_Chloropropane_1_2_diol (CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD) is a heat-produced contaminant formed during the preparation of soy sauce worldwide.
28070108	The present investigation was conducted to determine the molecular aspects of CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on SPECIES_9606_human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293).
28070108	Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed in response to exposure to CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD using the CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay and high-content screening (HCS).
28070108	DNA damage, intracellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated.
28070108	Genes related with apoptosis were detected by qPCR-array for further understanding the CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD induced cell apoptosis signaling pathway.
28070108	Our results clearly showed that CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD treatment inhibits cell proliferation and reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species generation.
28070108	qPCR-array indicated that nine apoptotic genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold and six down-regulated more than 2-fold.
28070108	Genes associated with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, especially GENE_596_BCL2 family genes, changed significantly, indicating that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated.
28070108	Death receptor pathway-related genes, GENE_4982_TNFRSF11B and GENE_7132_TNFRSF1A, changed significantly, indicating that the death receptor pathway is also activated, resulting in the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation as well as induction of apoptosis.
28070108	To sum up, the experiment results indicated that CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD induced HEK293 cell DISEASE_D064420_toxicity through the death receptor pathway and mitochondrial pathway.
28076683	Modulation of DISEASE_D064420_Cytotoxicity by Transcription-Coupled CHEMICAL_D009711_Nucleotide Excision Repair Is Independent of the Requirement for Bioactivation of CHEMICAL_C079422_Acylfulvene.
28076683	Bioactivation as well as DNA repair affects the susceptibility of DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells to the action of DNA-alkylating chemotherapeutic drugs.
28076683	However, information is limited with regard to the relative contributions of these processes to the biological outcome of metabolically activated DNA alkylating agents.
28076683	We evaluated the influence of cellular bioactivation capacity and DNA repair on DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of the DNA alkylating agent CHEMICAL_C079422_acylfulvene (AF).
28076683	We compared the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and RNA synthesis inhibition by AF and its synthetic activated analogue iso-M0 in a panel of fibroblast cell lines with deficiencies in transcription-coupled (TC-NER) or global genome CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER).
28076683	We related these data to the inherent bioactivation capacity of each cell type on the basis of mRNA levels.
28076683	We demonstrated that specific inactivation of TC-NER by siRNA had the largest positive impact on AF activity in a DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell line.
28076683	These findings establish that transcription-coupled DNA repair reduces cellular sensitivity to AF, independent of the requirement for bioactivation.
28073004	Epigenetic siRNA and Chemical Screens Identify GENE_387893_SETD8 Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy for GENE_7157_p53 Activation in High-Risk DISEASE_D009447_Neuroblastoma.
28073004	Given the paucity of druggable mutations in high-risk DISEASE_D009447_neuroblastoma (DISEASE_D009447_NB), we undertook chromatin-focused small interfering RNA and chemical screens to uncover epigenetic regulators critical for the differentiation block in high-risk DISEASE_D009447_NB.
28073004	High-content Opera imaging identified 53 genes whose loss of expression led to a decrease in DISEASE_D009447_NB cell proliferation and 16 also induced differentiation.
28073004	From these, the secondary chemical screen identified GENE_387893_SETD8, the H4<sup>K20me1</sup>methyltransferase, as a druggable DISEASE_D009447_NB target.
28073004	Functional studies revealed that GENE_387893_SETD8 ablation rescued the pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest functions of GENE_7157_p53 by decreasing GENE_7157_p53<sup>K382me1</sup>, leading to activation of the GENE_7157_p53 canonical pathway.
28073004	In pre-clinical SPECIES_1383439_xenograft DISEASE_D009447_NB models, genetic or pharmacological (UNC0379) GENE_387893_SETD8 inhibition conferred a significant survival advantage, providing evidence for GENE_387893_SETD8 as a therapeutic target in DISEASE_D009447_NB.
28077779	From the Cover: Embryonic Exposure to CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD Impacts Osteogenesis of the Axial Skeleton in SPECIES_8090_Japanese_medaka, SPECIES_8090_Oryzias_latipes.
28077779	Recent studies from SPECIES_9606_mammalian, SPECIES_7955_fish, and in vitro models have identified bone and cartilage development as sensitive targets for CHEMICAL_D004147_dioxins and other CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor ligands.
28077779	In this study, we assess how embryonic CHEMICAL__2_3_7_8_tetrachlorochlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) exposure impacts axial osteogenesis in SPECIES_8090_Japanese_medaka (SPECIES_8090_Oryzias_latipes), a vertebrate model of SPECIES_9606_human bone development.
28077779	SPECIES_6239_Embryos from inbred wild-type Orange-red Hd-dR and 3 transgenic SPECIES_8090_medaka lines (twist:EGFP, osx/GENE_101162038_sp7:mCherry, GENE_100529176_col10a1:nlGFP) were exposed to 0.15   nM and 0.3   nM CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD and reared until 20 dpf.
28077779	Individuals were stained for mineralized bone and imaged using confocal microscopy to assess skeletal alterations in medial vertebrae in combination with a qualitative spatial analysis of osteoblast and osteoblast progenitor cell populations.
28077779	Exposure to CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD resulted in an overall attenuation of vertebral ossification characterized by truncated centra, and reduced neural and hemal arch lengths.
28077779	Effects on mineralization were consistent with modifications in cell number and cell localization of CHEMICAL__transgene-labeled osteoblast and osteoblast progenitor cells.
28077779	Endogenous expression of osteogenic regulators runt-related transcription factor 2 (GENE_860_runx2) and osterix (osx/GENE_121340_sp7), and extracellular matrix genes GENE_6696_osteopontin (GENE_6696_spp1), collagen type I alpha I (col1), collagen type X alpha I (GENE_1300_col10a1), and GENE_632_osteocalcin (bglap/osc) was significantly diminished at 20 dpf following CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure as compared with controls.
28077779	Through global transcriptomic analysis more than 590 differentially expressed genes were identified and mapped to select pathological states including inflammatory disease, DISEASE_D003240_connective_tissue_disorders_and_skeletal_and_muscular_disorders.
28077779	Taken together, results from this study suggest that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure inhibits axial bone formation through dysregulation of osteoblast differentiation.
28077779	This approach highlights the advantages and sensitivity of using small SPECIES_7955_fish models to investigate how xenobiotic exposure may impact skeletal development.
28077780	Editor's Highlight: Exposure to CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI during Early Pregnancy Increases Oxidative Stress and Disrupts the Expression of Antioxidant Proteins in Placental Compartments.
28077780	Epidemiologic studies document relationships between CHEMICAL_C074702_chromium_VI (CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI) exposure and increased risk of DISEASE_D000022_spontaneous_abortion, stillbirth, DISEASE_D000014_preterm_birth, and DISEASE_D003643_neonatal_death in pregnant SPECIES_9606_women.
28077780	Environmental contamination with CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI is a growing problem both in the United States and developing countries.
28077780	CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI is widely used in numerous industries.
28077780	This study was designed to understand the mechanism of CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on placental oxidative stress and antioxidant (AOX) machinery.
28077780	Pregnant mother SPECIES_10116_rats were treated with or without CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI (50   ppm CHEMICAL_D011192_K2Cr2O7) through drinking water from gestational day (GD) 9.5-14.5, and placentas were analyzed on GD 18.5.
28077780	Results indicated that CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI reduced the trophoblast cell population.
28077780	CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI increased reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the expression of AOX proteins.
28077780	CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI disrupts the trophoblast proliferation of the placenta.
28077780	This study provides insight into the critical role of AOXs in placental function.
28079927	Developmental programming: Interaction between prenatal CHEMICAL__BPA and postnatal overfeeding on cardiac tissue gene expression in female SPECIES_9940_sheep.
28079927	Epidemiologic studies and studies in rodents point to potential risks from developmental exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA on cardiometabolic diseases.
28079927	Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that the manifestation and severity of adverse outcomes is the result of interaction between developmental insults and the prevailing environment.
28079927	Consistent with this premise, recent studies in SPECIES_9940_sheep found prenatal CHEMICAL__BPA treatment prevented the adverse effects of postnatal obesity in inducing hypertension.
28079927	The gene networks underlying these complex interactions are not known.
28079927	mRNA-seq of myocardium was performed on four groups of four female SPECIES_9940_sheep to assess the effects of prenatal CHEMICAL__BPA exposure, postnatal overfeeding and their interaction on gene transcription, pathway perturbations and functional effects.
28079927	The effects of prenatal exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA, postnatal overfeeding, and prenatal CHEMICAL__BPA with postnatal overfeeding all resulted in transcriptional changes (85-141 significant differentially expressed genes).
28079927	Although the effects of prenatal CHEMICAL__BPA and postnatal overfeeding did not involve dysregulation of many of the same genes, they affected a remarkably similar set of biological pathways.
28079927	Furthermore, an additive or synergistic effect was not found in the combined treatment group, but rather prenatal CHEMICAL__BPA treatment led to a partial reversal of the effects of overfeeding alone.
28079927	Many genes previously known to be affected by CHEMICAL__BPA and involved in obesity, hypertension, or heart disease were altered following these treatments, and AP-1, GENE_9940)_EGR1, and GENE_9940)_EGFR were key hubs affected by CHEMICAL__BPA and/or overfeeding.

28082111	Protective effects of CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin against CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity via adjusting GENE_9971_FXR-mediated oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28082111	CHEMICAL_C019357_Dioscin shows active effects against DISEASE_D007674_renal_ischemia/reperfusion injury and lipopolysaccharide-induced DISEASE_D007674_inflammatory_kidney_injury, however, little is known concerning the role of it on CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin (CHEMICAL_D004317_Dox)-induced nephrotoxicity.
28082111	In the present study, in vivo test of CHEMICAL_D004317_Dox-induced nephrotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_rats and in vitro model in NRK-52E cells were developed.
28082111	The results showed that CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin significantly DISEASE_C538265_attenuated_cell_injury, obviously reduced ROS level in vitro, and markedly decreased the levels of CHEMICAL__BUN, CHEMICAL_D002857_Cr, CHEMICAL_566274_MDA, and notably increased the levels of SOD, CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-Px in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28082111	Mechanistic studies showed that CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin significantly increased the levels of p-AMPKa, GENE_4780_Nrf2, GENE_3162_HO_1 and GST by activation of GENE_9971_FXR against oxidative stress.
28082111	In addition, CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-kB and GENE_3146_HMGB1, and subsequently decreased the mRNA levels of GENE_3553_IL_1b, GENE_3569_IL_6, and GENE_7124_TNF_a against DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28082111	These results were further validated by knockdown of GENE_10116)_FXR using siRNA silencing, and abrogation of GENE_10116)_FXR using NDB (a GENE_10116)_FXR inhibitor) in NRK-52E cells, and the results suggested that the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin against CHEMICAL_D004317_Dox- induced nephrotoxicity via adjusting GENE_10116)_FXR-mediated signal to suppress oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28082111	In addition, molecular docking assay showed that CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin directly targeted with GENE_9971_FXR through competing with Helix12 (H12) by CHEMICAL_D006859_hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect and electrostatic interactions.
28082111	In a word, our data showed that CHEMICAL_C019357_dioscin is a novel and potent GENE_9971_FXR agonist to suppress DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and oxidative stress against CHEMICAL_D004317_Dox-induced nephrotoxicity.
28077287	CHEMICAL_C000499_Iron_oxide nanoparticles modulate DISEASE_D012769_heat_shock proteins and organ specific markers expression in SPECIES_10090_mice male accessory organs.
28077287	With increased industrial utilization of CHEMICAL_C000499_iron_oxide nanoparticles (CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs), concerns on adverse reproductive health effects following exposure have been immensely raised.
28077287	In the present study, the effects of CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs exposure in the seminal vesicle and prostate gland were studied in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28077287	SPECIES_10090_Mice were exposed to two different doses (25 and 50 mg/kg) of CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs along with the control and analyzed the expressions of DISEASE_D012769_heat_shock proteins (GENE_10090)_HSP60, GENE_10090)_HSP70 and GENE_10090)_HSP90) and organ specific markers (GENE_10090)_Caltrin, GENE_10090)_PSP94, and GENE_10090)_SSLP1).
28077287	CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs decreased food consumption, water intake, and organo-somatic index in SPECIES_10090_mice with elevated CHEMICAL_D007501_iron levels in serum, urine, fecal matter, seminal vesicle and prostate gland.
28077287	FTIR spectra revealed alterations in the functional groups of biomolecules on CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs treatment.
28077287	These changes are accompanied by increased CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase levels with decreased total protein and CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose levels.
28077287	The investigation of oxidative stress biomarkers demonstrated a significant increase in reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species, CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide, lipid peroxidation, protein CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl content and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase with a concomitant decrement in the CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione and CHEMICAL_D001205_ascorbic_acid in the male accessory organs which confirmed the induction of oxidative stress.
28077287	An increase in CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH-oxidase-4 with a decrease in GENE_10090)_glutathione_S_transferase was observed in the seminal vesicle and prostate gland of the treated groups.
28077287	An alteration in GENE_10090)_HSP60, GENE_10090)_HSP70, GENE_10090)_HSP90, GENE_10090)_Caltrin, GENE_10090)_PSP94, and GENE_10090)_SSLP1 expression was also observed.
28077287	Moreover, accumulation of CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs brought pathological changes in the seminal vesicle and prostate gland of treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28077287	These findings provide evidence that CHEMICAL_50819_Fe2O3-NPs could be an environmental risk factor for reproductive disease.
28079798	Clinical and genetic factors associated with CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin maintenance dose in northern Chinese SPECIES_9606_patients with mechanical heart valve replacement.
28079798	The effects of genetic variants on CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dosing vary among different ethnic groups, especially in the Chinese population.
28079798	The objective of this study was to recruit SPECIES_9606_patients through a rigorous experimental design and to perform a comprehensive screen to identify gene polymorphisms that may influence CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dosing in northern Han Chinese SPECIES_9606_patients with mechanical heart valve replacement.
28079798	Consenting SPECIES_9606_patients (n=183) with a stable CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dose were included in this study.
28079798	Ninety-six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 30 genes involved in CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin pharmacological pathways were genotyped using the Illumina SNP GoldenGate Assay, and their associations with CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dosing were assessed using univariate regression analysis with post hoc comparison using least significant difference analysis.
28079798	Multiple linear regression was performed by incorporating SPECIES_9606_patients' clinical and genetic data to create a new algorithm for CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dosing.
28079798	From the 96 SNPs analyzed, GENE_79001_VKORC1 SNP_rs9923231_rs9923231, GENE_1544_CYP1A2 SNP_rs2069514_rs2069514, GENE_1576_CYP3A4 SNP_rs28371759_rs28371759, and GENE_348_APOE SNP_rs7412_rs7412 were associated with higher average CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin maintenance doses, whereas GENE_1559_CYP2C9 SNP_rs1057910_rs1057910, GENE_2052_EPHX1 SNP_rs2260863_rs2260863, and GENE_8529_CYP4F2 SNP_rs2189784_rs2189784 were associated with lower CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin doses (P<0.05).
28079798	Multiple linear regression analysis could estimate 44.4% of CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dose variability consisting of, in decreasing order, GENE_79001_VKORC1 SNP_rs9923231_rs9923231 (14.2%), GENE_1559_CYP2C9*3 (9.6%), body surface area (6.7%), GENE_1544_CYP1A2 SNP_rs2069514_rs2069514 (3.7%), age (2.7%), GENE_1576_CYP3A4 SNP_rs28371759_rs28371759 (2.5%), GENE_8529_CYP4F2 SNP_rs2108622_rs2108622 (1.9%), GENE_348_APOE SNP_rs7412_rs7412 (1.7%), and GENE_79001_VKORC1 SNP_rs2884737_rs2884737 (1.4%).
28079798	In the dosing algorithm we developed, we confirmed the strongest effects of GENE_79001_VKORC1, GENE_1559_CYP2C9 on CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dosing.
28079798	In the limited sample set, we also found that novel genetic predictors (GENE_1544_CYP1A2, GENE_1576_CYP3A4, GENE_348_APOE, GENE_2052_EPHX1, GENE_8529_CYP4F2, and GENE_79001_VKORC1 SNP_rs2884737_rs2884737) may be associated with CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin dosing.
28079798	Further validation is needed to assess our results in larger independent northern Chinese samples.
28084674	CHEMICAL_C032706_Sodium_chlorate, a major water disinfection byproduct, alters brush border membrane enzymes, CHEMICAL_16646_carbohydrate metabolism and impairs antioxidant system of Wistar SPECIES_10116_rat intestine.
28084674	CHEMICAL_C032706_Sodium_chlorate (CHEMICAL__NaClO3 ) is a widely used nonselective herbicide.
28084674	It is also generated as a by-product during disinfection of drinking water by CHEMICAL_C025109_chlorine_dioxide.
28084674	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of CHEMICAL__NaClO3 on SPECIES_10116_rat intestine.
28084674	Adult male SPECIES_10116_rats were randomly divided into five groups: control and remaining four groups were administered orally different doses of CHEMICAL__NaClO3 and sacrificed 24 h after the treatment.
28084674	The administration of CHEMICAL__NaClO3 produced acute oxidative stress in the intestine, which manifested in the form of markedly enhanced CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde levels and CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl content and lowered total CHEMICAL__sulfhydryl groups and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione levels.
28084674	The activities of several brush border membrane (BBM) enzymes were greatly reduced as compared to control.
28084674	There were alterations in the activities of various enzymes of CHEMICAL_16646_carbohydrate metabolism and those involved in maintaining the antioxidant defense system.
28084674	Histological studies support the biochemical results showing CHEMICAL__NaClO3 dose-dependent increase in tissue damage.
28084674	Thus, the present study shows that oral administration of CHEMICAL__NaClO3 decreases the activities of BBM enzymes, induces oxidative stress, alters metabolic pathways, and impairs the antioxidant system of SPECIES_10116_rat intestine.

28083739	Bioconcentration pattern and induced apoptosis of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryos at environmentally relevant concentrations.
28083739	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical that is ubiquitously present in the environment.
28083739	In the present study, 4-h post-fertilization (hpf) SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryos were exposed to various environmentally relevant concentrations of CHEMICAL__BPA (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000   g/L) until 72 and 168  hpf, and the accumulation pattern of CHEMICAL__BPA and its potential to induce DISEASE_D064420_toxicity through apoptosis were determined.
28083739	Compared to CHEMICAL__BPA concentrations in larvae at 168  hpf, CHEMICAL__BPA concentrations in embryos exposed until 72  hpf were at relatively higher levels (p  <  0.05) with higher bioconcentration factor (BCF) values.
28083739	The nonlinear fitting analysis indicated that the BCF values of CHEMICAL__BPA in fish embryos/larvae were significantly correlated to the log10-transformed CHEMICAL__BPA exposure concentrations in water in an inverse concentration-dependent manner.
28083739	Fish accumulated more CHEMICAL__BPA as the exposure concentrations increased; however, their accumulation capacity of CHEMICAL__BPA declined and tended to be saturated in the high exposure groups of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28083739	Moreover, GENE_7955)_caspase_3 activity was significantly induced upon CHEMICAL__BPA exposure at 0.1, 1, 10, and 100   g/L CHEMICAL__BPA at 72  hpf, and also at 10 and 100   g/L CHEMICAL__BPA at 168  hpf.
28083739	Correspondingly, exposure to 10 and 100   g/L of CHEMICAL__BPA significantly increased the DNA fragmentation in the extracted DNA at 168  hpf as determined by DNA ladder analysis.
28083739	In addition, the expression patterns of four genes related to apoptosis including GENE_7955)_caspase_3, GENE_7955)_bax, GENE_7955)_p53, and GENE_7955)_c_jun were significantly up-regulated (p  <  0.05) in fish embryos/larvae upon CHEMICAL__BPA exposure at 72 and 168  hpf.
28083739	Our results revealed that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of CHEMICAL__BPA could be significantly accumulated in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish and induced apoptosis with involvement of the regulation of GENE_7955)_caspase_3 and other apoptosis-related genes.
28085963	DISEASE_D013733_Testicular_Dysgenesis_Syndrome and Long-Lasting Epigenetic Silencing of SPECIES_10090_Mouse Sperm Genes Involved in the Reproductive System after Prenatal Exposure to DEHP.
28085963	UNASSIGNED: The endocrine disruptor CHEMICAL_D004051_bis_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (DEHP) has been shown to exert adverse effects on the male animal reproductive system.
28085963	However, its mode of action is unclear and a systematic analysis of its molecular targets is needed.
28085963	In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP during a critical period for gonads differentiation to testes on male SPECIES_10090_mice offspring reproductive parameters, including the genome-wide RNA expression and associated promoter methylation status in the sperm of the first filial generation.
28085963	It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D013733_testicular_dysgenesis_syndrome.
28085963	A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology.
28085963	It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system.
28085963	As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir-615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation.
28085963	A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and DISEASE_D009369_tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins.
28085963	All these enriched pathways and networks have been described to be associated in some way with the reproductive system.
28085963	This study identifies a large new array of genes dysregulated by DEHP that may play a role in the complex system controlling the development of the male reproductive system.
28087462	Impact of disease-Linked mutations targeting the oligomerization interfaces of CHEMICAL_D000079_aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1.
28087462	CHEMICAL_D000079_Aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 (ALDH7A1) is involved in CHEMICAL_25094_lysine catabolism, catalyzing the oxidation of CHEMICAL__a_aminoadipate_semialdehyde to CHEMICAL__a_aminoadipate.
28087462	Certain mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene, which are presumed to reduce catalytic activity, cause an autosomal recessive seizure disorder known as CHEMICAL_D011736_pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE).
28087462	Although the genetic association between ALDH7A1 and PDE is well established, little is known about the impact of PDE-mutations on the structure and catalytic function of the enzyme.
28087462	Herein we report the first study of the molecular consequences of PDE mutations using purified ALDH7A1 variants.
28087462	Eight variants, with mutations in the oligomer interfaces, were expressed in Escherichia coli: PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|P|78|L_P78L, PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|G|83|E_G83E, PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|A|129|P_A129P, PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|G|137|V_G137V, PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|G|138|V_G138V, PROTEINMUTATION_764417585_A149E, PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|G|255|D_G255D, and PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|G|263|E_G263E.
28087462	All but PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|P|78|L_P78L and PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|G|83|E_G83E were soluble and could be purified.
28087462	All six soluble mutants were catalytically inactive.
28087462	The impact of the mutations on oligomerization was assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation.
28087462	Wild-type ALDH7A1 is shown to exist in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of 16   M. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the variants reside in monomer-dimer equilibria and are apparently incapable of forming a tetrameric species, even at high enzyme concentration.
28087462	The available evidence suggests that they are misfolded assemblies lacking the three-dimensional structure required for catalysis.
28087833	Dysregulation of DISEASE_612348_MAP Kinase Signaling Pathways Including p38MAPK, GENE_10116)_SAPK/GENE_10116)_JNK, and GENE_50689;116590_ERK1_2 in Cultured SPECIES_10116_Rat Cerebellar Astrocytes Exposed to CHEMICAL_C493087_Diphenylarsinic_Acid.
28087833	CHEMICAL_C493087_Diphenylarsinic_acid (CHEMICAL__DPAA) was a major compound found in the CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic poisoning incident that occurred in Kamisu, Ibaraki, Japan in 2003.
28087833	SPECIES_9606_People exposed to CHEMICAL__DPAA via contaminated well water suffered from several DISEASE_D009422_neurological_disorders, DISEASE_D002526_including_cerebellar_symptoms.
28087833	We previously reported that CHEMICAL__DPAA induces cellular activation in cultured SPECIES_10116_rat cerebellar astrocytes, dose-dependent promotion of cell growth (low CHEMICAL__DPAA), cell DISEASE_D003643_death (high CHEMICAL__DPAA), and increased phosphorylation of DISEASE_612348_mitogen_activated_protein (DISEASE_612348_MAP) kinases (p38MAPK, GENE_10116)_SAPK/GENE_10116)_JNK, and GENE_50689;116590_ERK1_2).
28087833	Moreover, CHEMICAL__DPAA induces up-regulation of oxidative stress-counteracting proteins, activation of GENE_1385_CREB phosphorylation, increased protein expression of GENE_3725_c_Jun and GENE_2353_c_Fos, and aberrant secretion of brain-active cytokines (GENE_6347_MCP_1, GENE_133_adrenomedullin, GENE_2247_FGF2, GENE_2919_CXCL1, and GENE_3569_IL_6).
28087833	Here, we explored the role of DISEASE_612348_MAP kinases in CHEMICAL__DPAA-induced activation of astrocytes using specific DISEASE_612348_MAP kinase signaling inhibitors [CHEMICAL_C093642_SB203580 (p38MAPK), CHEMICAL_C432165_SP600125 (GENE_5601_SAPK/GENE_5599_JNK), CHEMICAL_C587178_SCH772984 (GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2), and CHEMICAL_C113580_U0126 (GENE_5604;5605_MEK1_2, a kinase for GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2)].
28087833	CHEMICAL__DPAA-induced activation of DISEASE_612348_MAP kinases had little contribution to CHEMICAL__DPAA-induced cell growth and DISEASE_D003643_death.
28087833	On the other hand, a power relationship among DISEASE_612348_MAP kinases was also observed, in which p38MAPK suppressed CHEMICAL__DPAA-induced GENE_5601_SAPK/GENE_5599_JNK and GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 activation, whereas GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 and GENE_5604;5605_MEK1_2 facilitated p38MAPK and GENE_5601_SAPK/GENE_5599_JNK activation.
28087833	In addition, GENE_5601_SAPK/GENE_5599_JNK had minimal effects on the activation of other DISEASE_612348_MAP kinases.
28087833	CHEMICAL__DPAA-induced activation of transcription factors and secretion of brain-active cytokines were submissively but intricately dominated by DISEASE_612348_MAP kinases.
28087833	Collectively, our results indicate that CHEMICAL__DPAA-induced activation of DISEASE_612348_MAP kinases is neither a cell growth-promoting response nor a cytoprotective one but leads to transcriptional disruption and aberrant secretion of brain-active cytokines in cerebellar astrocytes.
28087840	SPECIES_666_Vibrio_cholerae Cholix Toxin-Induced HepG2 Cell Death is Enhanced by Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Through ROS and Intracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases.
28087840	Cholix toxin (Cholix) from SPECIES_666_Vibrio_cholerae is a potent virulence factor exhibiting CHEMICAL_D000244_ADP-ribosyltransferase activity on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) of host cells, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis.
28087840	Administration of Cholix or its homologue Pseudomonas exotoxin A (SPECIES_3888_PEA) to SPECIES_10090_mice causes lethal hepatocyte damage.
28087840	In this study, we demonstrate DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of Cholix on SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes in the presence of DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor a (GENE_7124_TNF_a), which has been reported to play a fatal role in SPECIES_3888_PEA administered to SPECIES_10090_mice.
28087840	Compared with incubating HepG2 cells with Cholix alone, co-treatment with GENE_7124_TNF_a and Cholix (GENE_7124_TNF_a/Cholix) significantly enhanced the activation of caspases, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytoplasm, and CHEMICAL_D011064_poly_ADP_ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, while incubation with GENE_7124_TNF_a alone or co-treatment with GENE_7124_TNF_a/catalytically inactive Cholix did not.
28087840	In the early stage of cell death, Cholix increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (e.g., p38, ERK, JNK) and Akt, which was not affected by GENE_7124_TNF_a alone.
28087840	MAPK inhibitors (CHEMICAL_C432165_SP600125, CHEMICAL__SB20852, and CHEMICAL_C113580_U0126) suppressed PARP cleavage induced by GENE_7124_TNF_a/Cholix.
28087840	Protein kinase inhibitor CHEMICAL_C081021_Go6976 suppressed JNK phosphorylation and PARP cleavage by GENE_7124_TNF_a/Cholix.
28087840	In contrast, PKC activator CHEMICAL_60755_PMA in the absence of GENE_7124_TNF_a promoted Cholix-induced PARP cleavage.
28087840	Reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor, CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_cysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC), suppressed GENE_7124_TNF_a/Cholix-induced JNK and ERK phosphorylation, resulting in inhibition of PARP cleavage.
28087840	These data suggest that ROS and JNK pathways are important mediators of GENE_7124_TNF_a/Cholix-induced HepG2 cell death.
28088315	Paris CHEMICAL_D012503_saponin-induced autophagy promotes DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell apoptosis via the GENE_207_Akt/GENE_2475_mTOR signaling pathway.
28088315	Paris CHEMICAL_D012503_saponins possess anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects.
28088315	However, the anticancer effect of Paris CHEMICAL_D012503_saponins has not been well elucidated and the mechanisms underlying the potential function of Paris CHEMICAL_D012503_saponins in DISEASE_D009369_cancer therapy are needed to be further identify.
28088315	In this study, we report that CHEMICAL_D012503_saponin compounds isolated from Paris polyphylla exhibited antitumor activity against DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.
28088315	Paris CHEMICAL_D012503_saponin DISEASE_217000_XA_2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines, as evidenced by the activation of caspases and cleavage of GENE_142_Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase.
28088315	The ability of DISEASE_217000_XA_2 to induce autophagy was confirmed by CHEMICAL_D000165_acridine_orange staining, accumulation of autophagosome-bound Long chain 3 (LC3)-II, and measurement of autophagic flux.
28088315	DISEASE_217000_XA_2-induced autophagy was observed to promote apoptosis by the combined treatment of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell lines with DISEASE_217000_XA_2 and autophagy inhibitors CHEMICAL_C025946_3_methyladenine and CHEMICAL_C040929_bafilomycin_A1, respectively.
28088315	Moreover, we report a decrease in the levels of GENE_207_Akt/GENE_2475_mTOR signaling pathway proteins, such as the phosphorylated forms of GENE_207_Akt, GENE_2475_mTOR, GENE_6198_P70S6K, and GENE_1978_eukaryotic_translation_initiation_factor_4E_binding_protein_1 (GENE_1978_4EBP1).
28088315	Taken together, these results provide important insights explaining the anticancer activity of Paris CHEMICAL_D012503_saponins and the potential development of DISEASE_217000_XA_2 as a new therapeutic agent.
28089781	Genotoxic effect and SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocyte DISEASE_D003643_death occurred after oxidative stress induction and antioxidant gene downregulation caused by long term CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride exposure.
28089781	UNASSIGNED: Studies focusing on possible genotoxic effects of excess CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride are contradictory and inconclusive.
28089781	Currently, studies have reported a probable link to oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis induced by CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride in SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocytes.
28089781	We developed an in  vivo study administering three doses of CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride by gavage given to SPECIES_10116_rats for 60 day.
28089781	Micronucleus test was applied to investigate genotoxic potential of CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride.
28089781	The TUNEL method determined DNA fragmentation and apoptosis.
28089781	Biochemical parameters to investigate mitochondrial swelling and oxidative stress.
28089781	Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunostaining to determine mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant enzymes.
28089781	Analyses of the hepatic function and morphology were performed.
28089781	Our results revealed the genotoxic potential of CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride but did not confirm mitochondrial swelling nor an increase of positive TUNEL labelling induced by CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride, indicating absence of apoptosis.
28089781	Oxidative stress induction was confirmed and is probably associated to DNA damage.
28089781	Cell DISEASE_D003643_death events such as empty nuclear spaces, cytoplasm degeneration, nuclear pyknosis, karyorrhexis and karyorrhexis followed by karyolysis were observed.
28089781	Hepatic function did not appear to be significantly modified makes no evidence of DISEASE_D009336_necrosis and suggesting other cell DISEASE_D003643_death pathway, the autophagic.
28089781	In conclusion, prolonged CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride intake at chosen concentrations caused imbalance of the cellular oxidative state, affected DNA and disrupted cellular homeostasis.
28089781	It is recommended that CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride supplementation requires a fresh consideration in light of the current study.
28089945	CHEMICAL_D015025_Zearalenone exposure impairs ovarian primordial follicle formation via down-regulation of GENE_10090)_Lhx8 expression in vitro.
28089945	CHEMICAL_D015025_Zearalenone (CHEMICAL__ZEA) is an estrogenic mycotoxin mainly produced as a secondary metabolite by numerous species of Fusarium.
28089945	Previous work showed that CHEMICAL__ZEA had a negative impact on domestic animals with regard to reproduction.
28089945	The adverse effects and the mechanisms of CHEMICAL__ZEA on SPECIES_9606_mammalian ovarian folliculogenesis remain largely unknown, particularly its effect on primordial follicle formation.
28089945	Thus, we investigated the biological effects of CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure on SPECIES_10090_murine ovarian germ cell cyst breakdown and primordial follicle assembly.
28089945	Our results demonstrated that newborn SPECIES_10090_mouse ovaries exposed to 10 or 30 M CHEMICAL__ZEA in vitro had significantly less germ cell numbers compared to the control group.
28089945	Moreover, the presence of CHEMICAL__ZEA in vitro increased the numbers of TUNEL and yH2AX positive cells within SPECIES_10090_mouse ovaries and the ratio of mRNA levels of the apoptotic genes GENE_10090)_Bax/GENE_10090)_Bcl_2.
28089945	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure reduced the mRNA of oocyte specific genes such as GENE_10090)_LIM_homeobox_8 (GENE_10090)_Lhx8), newborn ovary homeobox (Nobox), spermatogenesis and oogenesis helix-loop-helix (GENE_10090)_Sohlh2), and GENE_10090)_factor_in_the_germline_alpha (Figla) in a dose dependent manner.
28089945	Exposure to CHEMICAL__ZEA led to remarkable changes in the GENE_10090)_Lhx8 3'-UTR DNA methylation dynamics in oocytes and severely impaired folliculogenesis in ovaries after transplantation under the kidney capsules of DISEASE_D007153_immunodeficient SPECIES_10090_mice.
28089945	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure impairs SPECIES_10090_mouse primordial follicle formation in vitro.
28089782	Hepatic co-cultures in vitro reveal suitable to detect GENE_4780_Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress responses on the bladder carcinogen CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine.
28089782	The CHEMICAL_33835_azo dye CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine is known as an industrial and environmental pollutant.
28089782	Metabolites of CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine remain in the liver for >24h.
28089782	However, the toxicological impact of CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine on the liver and its individual cell types, e.g., hepatocytes and immune cells, is currently poorly understood.
28089782	A novel co-culture system, composed of HepG2 or Huh-7 cells, and differentiated THP-1 cells was used to study the metabolic capacity towards CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine, and compared to primary SPECIES_10090_murine hepatocytes which express high enzyme activities.
28089782	As model compounds the carcinogenic CHEMICAL__arylamine_o_anisidine and its non-carcinogenic isomer, CHEMICAL_C013813_p_anisidine, as well as CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine were used.
28089782	Global proteome analysis revealed an activation of GENE_1965_eIF2 and GENE_4780_Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathways only in co-cultures after treatment with CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine.
28089782	This was confirmed via detection of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species.
28089782	In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased already after 3h treatment of cells, which correlated with a decrease of CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP levels (R(2)>0.92).
28089782	In the supernatant of co-cultured, but not single-cultured HepG2 and Huh-7 cells, CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine caused increases of damage-associated proteins, such as GENE_3146_HMGB1 (GENE_3146_high_mobility_group_box_1) protein.
28089782	In summary, only co-cultures of HepG2 and THP-1 cells predict CHEMICAL_C003898_o_anisidine induced stress responsive pathways, since the system has a higher sensitivity compared to single cultured cells.
28100771	GENE_10090)_Janus_Kinase_2 (GENE_10090)_JAK2) Dissociates Hepatosteatosis from DISEASE_D006528_Hepatocellular_Carcinoma in SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28100771	DISEASE_D006528_Hepatocellular_carcinoma is an end-stage complication of DISEASE_D065626_non_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease (DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD).
28100771	DISEASE_D007249_Inflammation plays a critical role in the progression of DISEASE_D065626_non_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease and the development of DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma.
28100771	However, whether DISEASE_D005234_steatosis<i>per se</i>promotes DISEASE_D008113_liver_cancer, and the molecular mechanisms that control the progression in this disease spectrum remain largely elusive.
28100771	The Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway mediates signal transduction by numerous cytokines that regulate DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis.
28100771	SPECIES_10090_Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of GENE_10090)_JAK2 (GENE_10090)_L_JAK2_KO) develop extensive DISEASE_D005234_fatty_liver spontaneously.
28100771	We show here that this simple DISEASE_D005234_steatosis was insufficient to drive DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28100771	In fact, GENE_10090)_L_JAK2_KO SPECIES_10090_mice were markedly protected from chemically induced DISEASE_D009369_tumor formation.
28100771	Using the CHEMICAL__methionine_choline-deficient dietary model to induce DISEASE_D005234_steatohepatitis, we found that DISEASE_D005234_steatohepatitis development was DISEASE_D006323_completely_arrested in GENE_10090)_L_JAK2_KO SPECIES_10090_mice despite the presence of DISEASE_D005234_steatosis, suggesting that GENE_10090)_JAK2 is the critical factor required for inflammatory progression in the liver.
28100771	In line with this, GENE_10090)_L_JAK2_KO SPECIES_10090_mice exhibited DISEASE_D007249_attenuated_inflammation after chemical carcinogen challenge.
28100771	This was associated with increased hepatocyte apoptosis without elevated compensatory proliferation, thus thwarting expansion of transformed hepatocytes.
28100771	Taken together, our findings identify an indispensable role of GENE_3717_JAK2 in hepatocarcinogenesis through regulating critical inflammatory pathways.
28100771	Targeting the JAK-STAT pathway may provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma.
28101945	GENE_1956_Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR)-MAPK-nuclear factor(NF)-kB-IL8: A possible mechanism of particulate matter(PM) 2.5-induced DISEASE_D008171_lung_toxicity.
28101945	Airway DISEASE_D007249_inflammation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of diverse DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_diseases.
28101945	In this study, we investigated whether exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5, a PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5   m, enhances DISEASE_D007249_inflammation-related DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in the SPECIES_9606_human respiratory system through activation of the GENE_1956_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR) signaling pathway.
28101945	Through cytokine antibody array analysis of two extracts of PM2.5 [water (W-PM2.5 ) and organic (CHEMICAL__O-PM2.5 ) soluble extracts] exposed to A549 (SPECIES_9606_human alveolar epithelial cell), we identified eight cytokines changed their expression with W-PM2.5 and three cytokines with CHEMICAL__O-PM2.5 .
28101945	Among them, GENE_1950_epidermal_growth_factor (GENE_1950_EGF) was commonly up-regulated by W-PM2.5 and CHEMICAL__O-PM2.5 .
28101945	Then, in both groups, we can identify the increase in GENE_1950_EGF receptor protein levels.
28101945	Likewise, increases in the phosphorylation of GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 MAP kinase and acetylation of nuclear factor(NF)-kB were detected.
28101945	We also detected an increase in GENE_3576_IL_8 that was related to inflammatory response.
28101945	And using the CHEMICAL_C400278_erlotinib as an inhibitor of GENE_1956_EGFR, we identified the CHEMICAL_C400278_erlotinib impaired the phosphorylation of GENE_1956_EGFR, GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2, acetylation of NF-kB proteins and decreased GENE_3576_IL_8.
28101945	Furthermore, at in vivo model, we were able to identify similar patterns.
28101945	These results suggest that PM2.5 may contribute to an abnormality in the SPECIES_9606_human respiratory system through GENE_1956_EGFR, MAP kinase, NF-kB, and GENE_3576_IL_8 induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity signaling.

28104404	CHEMICAL_D003993_Dibutyl_phthalate impairs steroidogenesis and a subset of LH-dependent genes in cultured SPECIES_9606_human mural granulosa cell in vitro.
28104404	Exposure to CHEMICAL_D003993_di_butyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_35861_DBP) exerts negative effects on female fertility in animal models, but SPECIES_9606_human studies remain limited.
28104404	Here, the effects of CHEMICAL_35861_DBP exposure on mural granulosa cell function were investigated in primary cultures from SPECIES_9606_women undergoing in vitro fertilization.
28104404	Cultured cells treated with various doses of CHEMICAL_35861_DBP (0, 0.01 g/mL, 0.1 g/mL, 1 g/mL, 10 g/mL, or 100 g/mL) for 48h were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and qRT-PCR.
28104404	Treatment with 100 g/mL CHEMICAL_35861_DBP resulted in significantly lower CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol and CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone production (p<0.01).
28104404	It also resulted in altered mRNA expression of steroidogenic, angiogenic, and epidermal growth factor-like growth factor genes: GENE_1583_CYP11A1 (p<0.001), GENE_1588_CYP19A1 (aromatase) (p<0.001), GENE_7422_VEGF_A (p<0.02), CHEMICAL__BTC (p=0.009), and GENE_2069_EREG (p=0.04).
28104404	StAR expression was impaired after exposure to both 10 and 100 g/mL (p<0.03 and p<0.001, respectively).
28104404	Our results indicate that in vitro exposure of granulosa cells to high doses of CHEMICAL_35861_DBP alters cell functions.
28108221	GENE_23411_Sirtuin_1 independent effects of CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol in INS-1E b-cells.
28108221	CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol (CHEMICAL__Resv), a natural CHEMICAL_26195_polyphenol, is suggested to have various health benefits including improved insulin sensitivity.
28108221	CHEMICAL__Resv activates Sirtuin (GENE_23411_Sirt1) in several species and tissues.
28108221	GENE_23411_Sirt1 is a protein deacetylase with an important role in ageing, metabolism and b-cell function.
28108221	In insulinoma b-cells (INS-1E), CHEMICAL__Resv is previously shown to improve CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in a GENE_23411_Sirt1-dependent mechanism and to protect against b-cell dedifferentiation in non-SPECIES_9606_human primates, while inducing DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy in myoblasts.
28108221	SPECIES_9606_Mammalian (mechanistic) Target of CHEMICAL_D020123_Rapamycin (GENE_2475_mTOR), is a key regulator of cellular metabolism and regulates the cell size, b-cell survival and proliferation.
28108221	In order to understand the interaction of GENE_23411_Sirt1 and GENE_2475_mTOR cascade activity with CHEMICAL__Resv-induced changes in the INS-1E cell line, we generated stable GENE_23411_Sirt1-down-regulated INS-1E cells, and analysed GENE_23411_Sirt1-dependent effects of CHEMICAL__Resv with respect to GENE_2475_mTOR cascade activity.
28108221	GENE_23411_Sirt1-knockdown (KD) had a significant increase in cell size compared to negative-control (NEG CTR) cells.
28108221	CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol treatment increased cell size in both cell types in a dose-dependent manner at 24  h (CHEMICAL__Resv conc: 15-60   M), and decreased the cell number (CHEMICAL__Resv conc: 30-60   M).
28108221	Cell area was increased in NEG CTR cells (CHEMICAL__Resv conc: 60   M) at 24  h and KD cells at 48  h (CHEMICAL__Resv conc: 15-60   M).
28108221	CHEMICAL_D020123_Rapamycin, a specific GENE_2475_mTOR inhibitor, counteracted the CHEMICAL__Resv-induced cell enlargement (both cell diameter and area).
28108221	Furthermore, GENE_23411_Sirt1-downregulation by itself did not affect the GENE_2475_mTOR cascade activities as measured by Western blotting for total and phosphorylated Akt and GENE_2475_mTOR.
28108221	CHEMICAL_D020123_Rapamycin decreased the GENE_10090)_mTORC1 activity, while increasing the pAkt levels.
28108221	CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol did not interfere with the GENE_2475_mTOR activity or with GENE_23411_Sirt1 expression.
28108221	Altogether, this work indicates that GENE_23411_Sirt1 is a negative regulator of cell size.
28108221	Moreover, the effect of CHEMICAL__Resv on cell size increase is GENE_2475_mTOR-cascade dependent.
28108222	CHEMICAL_D004178_Diquat-induced cellular CHEMICAL_36980_pyridine_nucleotide redox changes and alteration of metabolic enzyme activities in DISEASE_D003110_colonic_carcinoma cells.
28108222	UNASSIGNED: Previously we have shown that the redox cycler CHEMICAL_D024483_menadione (MQ) induced cellular CHEMICAL_36980_pyridine_nucleotide redox imbalance that was linked to a decrease in aerobic glycolysis and perturbation of the mitochondrial respiratory activity due to the redox cycling of the compound; these processes were potentiated by low CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose.
28108222	In this study, we investigated how colonic epithelial cells maintained CHEMICAL_36980_pyridine_nucleotide (CHEMICAL_D009243_NAD_/NADH and CHEMICAL_D009249_NADP_/CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH) redox homeostasis upon acute metabolic variation and exposure to the redox cycling CHEMICAL_D004178_diquat (DQ).
28108222	Our results show that DQ challenge disrupted cellular NADH/NAD(+) redox status and enhanced cellular CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH generation.
28108222	Notably, DQ-induced NADH decrease was associated with enhanced CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate production, a process that was potentiated by CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose availability, but not by the mitochondrial substrates, CHEMICAL_D019802_succinate or CHEMICAL_C030298_malate/CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate.
28108222	In addition, DQ increased CHEMICAL__glucose_6_phoshate dehydrogenase (GENE_9563_G6PDH) activity consistent with CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose diversion towards CHEMICAL_D010428_pentose_phosphate pathway.
28108222	As a consequence, steady-state CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH levels were maintained during MQ challenge at normal CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose.
28108222	In contrast and despite increased GENE_9563_G6PDH and malic enzyme (ME) activities, DQ induced cellular CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH-to-CHEMICAL_D009249_NADP_ shift at low CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, a situation that was reversed by mitochondrial substrates.
28108222	Collectively, these results are consistent with increased aerobic glycolysis by DQ and specific metabolic changes leading to enhanced CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH generation upon oxidative challenge.
28108387	Inhibition of CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine oxidase-B by CHEMICAL_D012642_selegiline reduces cigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in airway epithelial cells.
28108387	UNASSIGNED: DISEASE_D029424_Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease (DISEASE_D029424_COPD) is caused by the build-up of oxidative stress-induced damages due to cigarette smoking, but how CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B signaling is involved remains unclear.
28108387	This study aims to establish the involvement of GENE_4129_MAO_B signaling pathways in cigarette smoke medium (CSM)-induced oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in SPECIES_9606_human airway epithelial cells (AECs).
28108387	CSM treatment increased GENE_4129_MAO_B activity, ROS levels and GENE_3576_IL_8 release in AECs.
28108387	Pretreatment with GENE_4129_MAO_B selective inhibitor CHEMICAL_D012642_selegiline reversed the CSM-induced changes in GENE_4129_MAO_B activity, ROS levels and GENE_3576_IL_8 release in a dose-dependent manner.
28108387	CHEMICAL_D012642_Selegiline also reversed CSM-induced changes of anti-oxidant enzymes GENE_6647_superoxide_dismutase (GENE_6647_SOD) and catalase (GENE_847_CAT) activities, CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH/CHEMICAL_D019803_GSSG ratio, as well expression of CHEMICAL_D006418_heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and GENE_1728_NAD_P_H_quinone_dehydrogenase_1 (GENE_1728_NQO1).
28108387	The effects of CHEMICAL_D012642_selegiline are partially driven through the GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2 (GENE_4780_Nrf2) and cytosol translocation of its negative regulator, GENE_571_BTB_and_CNC_homolog_1 (GENE_571_Bach1).
28108387	Nevertheless, CHEMICAL_D012642_selegiline fully reversed the CSM-induced effects on IKK, cytoplasmic IkB expression, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) p65 subunit.
28108387	Our study demonstrated that in AECs, inhibition of GENE_4129_MAO_B using CHEMICAL_D012642_selegiline reversed the CSM-induced oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28108387	These data may provide a novel strategy for therapy in DISEASE_D029424_COPD.
28108665	Fasiglifam (CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875) Alters CHEMICAL_3098_Bile_Acid Homeostasis in SPECIES_10116_Rats and SPECIES_9615_Dogs: A Potential Cause of DISEASE_D056486_Drug_Induced_Liver_Injury.
28108665	Fasiglifam (CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875), a GENE_9615)_Free_Fatty_Acid_Receptor_1 (GENE_9615)_FFAR1) agonist in development for the treatment of type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes, was voluntarily terminated in phase 3 due to adverse liver effects.
28108665	A mechanistic investigation described in this manuscript focused on the inhibition of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid (BA) transporters as a driver of the liver findings.
28108665	CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875 was an in vitro inhibitor of multiple influx (NTCP and OATPs) and efflux (BSEP and MRPs) hepatobiliary BA transporters at micromolar concentrations.
28108665	Repeat dose studies determined that CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875 caused a dose-dependent increase in serum total BA in SPECIES_10116_rats and SPECIES_9615_dogs.
28108665	Additionally, there were dose-dependent increases in both unconjugated and conjugated individual BAs in both species.
28108665	SPECIES_10116_Rats had an increase in serum markers of DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury without correlative microscopic signs of DISEASE_D017695_tissue_damage.
28108665	Two of 6 SPECIES_9615_dogs that received the highest dose of CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875 developed DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury with clinical pathology changes, and by microscopic analysis had portal granulomatous DISEASE_D007249_inflammation with neutrophils around a crystalline deposition.
28108665	The BA composition of SPECIES_9615_dog bile also significantly changed in a dose-dependent manner following CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875 administration.
28108665	At the highest dose, levels of CHEMICAL_D013656_taurocholic_acid were 50% greater than in controls with a corresponding 50% decrease in CHEMICAL_D013655_taurochenodeoxycholic_acid.
28108665	Transporter inhibition by CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875 may cause DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in SPECIES_9615_dogs through altered CHEMICAL__bile_BA composition characteristics, as evidenced by crystalline deposition, likely composed of test article, in the bile duct.
28108665	In conclusion, a combination of in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that BA transporter inhibition could contribute to CHEMICAL_C557331_TAK_875-mediated DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in SPECIES_9615_dogs.
28108667	Effects on Circulating CHEMICAL_D013256_Steroid Hormones and Gene Expression along the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis in Adult SPECIES_93934_Japanese_Quail Exposed to CHEMICAL__17b_Trenbolone across Multiple Generations.
28108667	We investigated the effects of the androgenic growth promoter CHEMICAL__17b_trenbolone (CHEMICAL__17bTB) on adult SPECIES_93934_Japanese_quail (SPECIES_93934_Coturnix_japonica) exposed across three generations.
28108667	The F0 generation was exposed after sexual maturity to 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40   ppm through feed.
28108667	The F1 generation was exposed in ovo by maternal transfer and through feed at the same doses as their parents.
28108667	The F2 generation was exposed in ovo only.
28108667	Levels of plasma sex CHEMICAL_D013256_steroids, gonadal Cytochrome P450 aromatase (GENE_107318718_CYP19A1) mRNA and select brain neuroendocrine peptide mRNAs were measured.
28108667	In males, CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels did not differ in any generation from those in controls.
28108667	CHEMICAL_D004958_Estradiol was significantly elevated in CHEMICAL__17bTB treated F0 and F1 males.
28108667	In F0 and F1 females, CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone was suppressed by CHEMICAL__17bTB, whereas CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol was significantly higher at 40   ppm in F0 and at 10   ppm in F1 females.
28108667	GENE_107318718_CYP19A1 expression in F1 males and females increased suggesting a compensatory response to the androgenic effects of CHEMICAL__17bTB.
28108667	Few significant effects were observed in the F2 birds indicating that in ovo exposure had limited effects on the monitored endpoints.
28108667	Overall, our results confirmed endocrine disrupting effects of dietary CHEMICAL__17bTB in SPECIES_93934_Japanese_quail but the response was dependent on sex, developmental stage at initiation of exposure, and dose.
28109747	CHEMICAL_D012834_Silver nanoparticles induce hormesis in A549 SPECIES_9606_human epithelial cells.
28109747	Despite the gaps in our knowledge on the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D012834_silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), the application of these materials is fast expanding, from medicine, to food as well as the use in consumer products.
28109747	It has been reported that prolonged exposure might make cells more resistant to AgNPs.
28109747	This prompted us to investigate if AgNPs may give rise to a hormetic response.
28109747	Two types of AgNPs were used, i.e.
28109747	colloidal AgNPs and an AgNP powder.
28109747	For both types of nanosilver it was found that a low dose pretreatment of A549 SPECIES_9606_human epithelial cells with AgNPs induced protection against a toxic dose of AgNPs and CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein.
28109747	This protection was more pronounced after pretreatment with the colloidal AgNPs.
28109747	Interestingly, the mechanism of the hormetic response appeared to differ from that of CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein.
28109747	Adaptation to CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein is related to GENE_4780_Nrf2 translocation, increased mRNA expression of yGCS, GENE_3162_HO_1 and increased CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels and the increased CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels can explain the hormetic effect.
28109747	The adaptive response to AgNPs was not related to an increase in mRNA expression of yGCS and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels.
28109747	Yet, GENE_3162_HO_1 mRNA expression and GENE_4780_Nrf2 immunoreactivity were enhanced, indicating that these processes might be involved.
28109747	So, AgNPs induce adaptation, but in contrast to CHEMICAL__acrolein_GSH plays no role.
28108160	Exposure to CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan increases endothelial permeability by transcellular and paracellular pathways in relation to DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases.
28108160	Exposure to environmental pollutants results in out-of-balance of vascular homeostasis.
28108160	DISEASE_D008107_Endothelial_dysfunction leads to a disruption of the endothelial permeability characteristics, associated with DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases.
28108160	We previously reported that CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan could cause DISEASE_D008107_endothelial_dysfunction, but the role of CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan in permeability of endothelial cells has been unexplored.
28108160	To elucidate molecular mechanism of CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan-induced changes in endothelial permeability, SPECIES_9606_human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan, followed by endothelial permeability analysis.
28108160	The results showed that permeability of HUVECs was enhanced at 48  h after exposure to CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan in a dose-dependent manner.
28108160	Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated the disruptions of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion in CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan-exposed cells.
28108160	CHEMICAL_D004726_Endosulfan activated GENE_4314_MMP3/GENE_3915_LAMC1/FAK signaling pathway, and downregulated ROCK and GENE_5829_PXN in transcellular pathway.
28108160	CHEMICAL_D004726_Endosulfan affected adherens junctions via GENE_999_E_cadherin and GENE_1499_b_catenin, and impaired gap junctions through downregulation of GENE_2697_Cx43 in paracellular pathway.
28108160	We predicted four closely related SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases in Nextbio, including shock, DISEASE_D003324_coronary_arteriosclerosis, DISEASE_D006331_disorder_of_cardiac_function and DISEASE_D006973_hypertensive_disorder in relation to CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan exposure.
28108160	Some genes such as GENE_9475_ROCK2 and GENE_5829_PXN were predicted to be key genes in these diseases.
28108160	These findings suggest that CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan increased endothelial permeability by paracellular and transcellular pathways, implicating the potential correlation between CHEMICAL_D004726_endosulfan and DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases.
28108161	Behavioral response and gene expression changes in CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil-administered male SPECIES_93934_Japanese_quail (SPECIES_93934_Coturnix_japonica).
28108161	UNASSIGNED: CHEMICAL_C082360_Fipronil is an important member of the CHEMICAL__phenylpyrazole group of insecticides and is widely used for various crops and vegetables to control insects, thereby exposing birds, animals, and SPECIES_9606_humans to CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil.
28108161	Currently, there is limited information on the effects of CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil exposure in SPECIES_93934_Japanese_quail.
28108161	Therefore, our aim was to assess the reproductive toxicological effects of CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil in the SPECIES_93934_Japanese_quail in a 15-day gavage study and then its recovery over a period of 60 days.
28108161	CHEMICAL_C082360_Fipronil-administration led to significant losses in both feed intake and body weight.
28108161	Whereas, the gonadosomatic index was not affected, and histological changes observed in the testes were reversible, particularly by day 45 and day 60 of recovery.
28108161	Cloacal gland atrophy, reduced foam quantity and a reduction in fertility, DISEASE_D001523_sexual_and_aggressive_behaviors, and serum CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone with elevated CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol (E2) hormone levels were also observed.
28108161	All these changes gradually reversed during various recovery periods.
28108161	Further, alterations in hepatic GENE_107317565_vitellogenin (GENE_107317565_Vtg) and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor a (ERa) gene expression, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were also observed.
28108161	Specifically, ERa1 was induced after CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil administration, while the GENE_107317565_Vtg transcript was elevated during both exposure and recovery periods.
28108161	Our results showed that CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil exposure has a profound negative influence on reproductive traits in the male SPECIES_93934_Japanese_quail and exhibits an estrogenic activity that can raise the incidence of DISEASE_D007246_infertility in males.
28108161	Nevertheless, most of the changes could be reversed after a recovery period of 30-45 days.
28111094	Peri-pubertal high CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine exposure increases ovarian CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol production in immature SPECIES_10116_rats.
28111094	Chronic CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine consumption exerts a negligible effect on the reproductive organs of normal adult females, but it is not known whether this is also true for SPECIES_9606_children and adolescents.
28111094	Here, we investigated the effects of high CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine exposure on sexual maturation and ovarian CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol production in immature female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28111094	Immature female SD SPECIES_10116_rats were divided into controls and CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine groups fed 120 and 180mg/kg/day for 4 or 8 weeks.
28111094	There was a significant delay in vaginal opening in the CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine-fed groups.
28111094	In addition, serum CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol levels were elevated in the CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine-fed animals after 2 and 4 weeks of exposure.
28111094	CHEMICAL_D004958_Estradiol secretion as well as aromatase expression also increased significantly in the ovarian cells in response to CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine.
28111094	These results demonstrate that peripubertal exposure to high CHEMICAL_D002110_caffeine increases CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol production in the ovary; this may disturb the coordinated regulation of the hypothalamo-DISEASE_D010051_pituitary_ovarian_axis, thereby interfering with sexual maturation.
28111842	Detoxification of CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene primarily depends on cytochrome P450, while bioactivation involves additional oxidoreductases including GENE_10090)_5_lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and aldo-keto reductase in the liver.
28111842	Cytochrome P450s are involved in detoxification and activation of CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (CHEMICAL_29022_BaP) with unclear balance and unknown contribution of other oxidoreductases.
28111842	Here, we investigated the CHEMICAL_29022_BaP and CHEMICAL_29022_BaP-induced mutagenicity in hepatic and extra-hepatic tissues using hepatic P450 reductase null (HRN) gpt SPECIES_10090_mice.
28111842	After 2-week treatment (50  mg/kg, i.p.
28111842	4 days), CHEMICAL_29022_BaP in the liver and lung of HRN-gpt SPECIES_10090_mice were increased.
28111842	CHEMICAL_29022_BaP promoted gpt mutant frequency (MF) in HRN-gpt SPECIES_10090_mice liver.
28111842	MF of gpt in the lung and SPECIES_9823_Pig-a in hematopoietic cells induced by CHEMICAL_29022_BaP in HRN-gpt SPECIES_10090_mice were increased than in gpt SPECIES_10090_mice.
28111842	CHEMICAL__BaP_7_8_diol_9_10_epoxide (CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE)-DNA adducts in vitro was analyzed for enzymes detection in CHEMICAL_29022_BaP bioactivation.
28111842	Specific inhibitors of GENE_10090)_5_lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase-1_2, and aldo-keto reductase resulted in more than 80% inhibition rate in the DNA adduct formation, further confirmed by SPECIES_9541_Macaca_fascicularis hepatic S9 system.
28111842	Our results suggested the detoxification of CHEMICAL_29022_BaP primarily depends on cytochrome P450, while the bioactivation involves additional oxidoreductases.
28110601	The effects of CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity via the GENE_10116)_NF_kB-GENE_10116)_iNOS pathway in SPECIES_10116_rat liver.
28110601	CHEMICAL_D012402_Rotenone has been used as a pesticide for many years, it is an environmental poison reported to cause DISEASE_D009422_neurological_diseases.
28110601	However, the effects of CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone on the SPECIES_10116_rat liver are unclear, as are the mechanisms of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28110601	In the present study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) SPECIES_10116_rats were divided into five groups: control, CHEMICAL_D004121_dimethyl_sulfoxide (CHEMICAL_D004121_DMSO), CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone low-dose (1   mg/kg), CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone mid-dose (2   mg/kg) and CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone high-dose (4   mg/kg).
28110601	The treatments were orally administered daily for 28 days, we assessed health status, mRNA expression levels of inflammatory factors, protein levels, CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO) content and histological changes.
28110601	The results showed that body weight was significantly decreased in each CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone group in a dose-dependent manner, compared with the control group.
28110601	CHEMICAL_D012402_Rotenone significantly increased the mRNA levels of GENE_10116)_cyclooxygenase_2 (GENE_10116)_COX_2), nuclear factor kappaB (GENE_10116)_NF_kB), CHEMICAL_D015232_prostaglandin_E2 (CHEMICAL_D015232_PGE2), GENE_10116)_inducible_nitric_oxide_synthase (GENE_10116)_iNOS) and DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor (GENE_103694380_TNF_a) in each CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone group compared with the control group, except GENE_10116)_iNOS and GENE_103694380_TNF_a mRNA expression in the low-dose group.
28110601	The protein levels of GENE_10116)_COX_2 were significantly higher in each CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone group compared with the control group, GENE_10116)_NF_kB protein expression were significantly higher in the CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone mid and high-dose groups, but not in the low-dose group, compared with the control group, similar changes were observed in NO content.
28110601	Additionally, histological analysis revealed that the most severe DISEASE_D017695_tissue_damage occurred in the high-dose group.
28110601	These results indicated that CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone has toxic effect in SPECIES_10116_rat liver relating to inflammatory factors.
28110601	Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone hepatotoxicity.
28111121	Risk factors for the onset and progression of DISEASE_D006816_Huntington_disease.
28111121	DISEASE_D006816_Huntington_s_disease (DISEASE_D006816_HD) is an DISEASE_D020271_autosomal_dominant_neurodegenerative_disorder characterized by DISEASE_D002819_chorea, behavioural and DISEASE_D001523_psychiatric manifestations, and DISEASE_D003704_dementia, caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the GENE_3064_huntingtin gene.
28111121	Systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the risk factors for the onset and progression of DISEASE_D006816_HD.
28111121	Multiple databases were searched, using terms specific to DISEASE_D006816_Huntington_disease and to studies of aetiology, risk, prevention and genetics, limited to studies on SPECIES_9606_human subjects published in English or French between 1950 and 2010.
28111121	Two reviewers independently screened the abstracts and identified potentially relevant articles for full-text review using predetermined inclusion criteria.
28111121	Three major categories of risk factors for onset of DISEASE_D006816_HD were identified: CAG repeat length in the GENE_3064_huntingtin gene, CAG instability, and genetic modifiers.
28111121	Of these, CAG repeat length in the GENE_3064_huntingtin gene is the most important risk factor.
28111121	For the progression of DISEASE_D006816_HD: genetic, demographic, past medical/clinical and environmental risk factors have been studied.
28111121	Of these factors, genetic factors appear to play the most important role in the progression of DISEASE_D006816_HD.
28111121	Among the potential risk factors, CAG repeat length in the mutant allele was found to be a relatively consistent and significant risk factor for the progression of DISEASE_D006816_HD, especially in motor, cognitive, and other neurological symptom deterioration.
28111121	In addition, there were many consistent results in the literature indicating that a higher number of CAG repeats was associated with shorter survival, faster institutionalization, and earlier percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
28111160	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A and its derivatives CHEMICAL_C020806_tetrabromobisphenol_A and CHEMICAL_C041181_tetrachlorobisphenol_A induce apelin expression and secretion in DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells through a GENE_5468_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_gamma-dependent mechanism.
28111160	UNASSIGNED: Epidemiological studies have reported that SPECIES_9606_humans have detectable levels of not only CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), but also its halogenated derivatives CHEMICAL_C020806_tetrabromobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TBBPA) and CHEMICAL_C041181_tetrachlorobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TCBPA), in the serum.
28111160	Our previous study showed that CHEMICAL__BPA promotes DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer progression by directly inducing cell proliferation and migration or by indirectly increasing leptin receptor expression, which creates more binding sites for leptin.
28111160	In this study, we examined the expression of apelin and its receptor in DISEASE_D009369_non_cancer and DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell lines derived from the SPECIES_9606_human ovary, and further explored whether the expression of apelin and its receptor is modulated by CHEMICAL__BPA and its derivatives.
28111160	We found that the apelin receptor expression level was higher in epithelial DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells than in granulosa DISEASE_D009369_tumour cells, whereas the reverse was true for apelin expression and secretion.
28111160	CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__TBBPA and CHEMICAL__TCBPA at low nanomolar concentrations increased apelin expression and secretion in the DISEASE_D010051_epithelial_ovarian_cancer cell line OVCAR-3, which involved the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y but not CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen receptors.
28111160	We also found evidence that secreted apelin acts as a mitogenic factor in SPECIES_9606_OVCAR_3 cells, and that CHEMICAL__BPA intensifies its activity.
28111160	Taken together, our results suggest that CHEMICAL__BPA and its derivatives induce DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cell progression by up-regulating apelin, which acts as a mitogenic factor in these cells.
28111298	CHEMICAL__Aerosol from SPECIES_4097_Tobacco Heating System 2.2 has reduced impact on SPECIES_10090_mouse heart gene expression compared with cigarette smoke.
28111298	Experimental studies clearly demonstrate a causal effect of cigarette smoking on DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease.
28111298	To reduce the individual risk and population harm caused by smoking, alternative products to cigarettes are being developed.
28111298	We recently reported on an GENE_10090)_apolipoprotein_E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) SPECIES_10090_mouse inhalation study that compared the effects of exposure to aerosol from a candidate modified risk SPECIES_4097_tobacco product, SPECIES_4097_Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS2.2), and smoke from the reference cigarette (3R4F) on pulmonary and vascular biology.
28111298	Here, we applied a transcriptomics approach to evaluate the impact of the exposure to 3R4F smoke and THS2.2 aerosol on heart tissues from the same cohort of SPECIES_10090_mice.
28111298	The systems response profiles demonstrated that 3R4F smoke exposure led to time-dependent transcriptomics changes (False Discovery Rate (FDR)  <  0.05; 44 differentially expressed genes at 3-months; 491  at 8-months).
28111298	Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the heart tissue indicated that CHEMICAL__3R4F exposure induced the downregulation of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization and the contractile function of the heart, notably genes that encode GENE_10090)_beta_actin (GENE_10090)_Actb), GENE_10090)_actinin_alpha_4 (GENE_10090)_Actn4), and GENE_10090)_filamin_C (GENE_10090)_Flnc).
28111298	This was accompanied by the downregulation of genes related to the inflammatory response.
28111298	None of these effects were observed in the group exposed to THS2.2 aerosol.
28112739	Acquired GENE_1588_CYP19A1 amplification is an early specific mechanism of aromatase inhibitor resistance in GENE_2099_ERa metastatic DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28112739	DISEASE_D009369_Tumor evolution is shaped by many variables, potentially involving external selective pressures induced by therapies.
28112739	After surgery, patients with estrogen receptor (GENE_2099_ERa)-positive DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer are treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and/or aromatase inhibitors (AIs).
28112739	However, more than 20% of patients relapse within 10 years and eventually progress to incurable DISEASE_D009362_metastatic_disease.
28112739	Here we demonstrate that the choice of therapy has a fundamental influence on the genetic landscape of relapsed diseases.
28112739	We found that 21.5% of AI-treated, relapsed patients had acquired GENE_1588_CYP19A1 (encoding aromatase) amplification (GENE_1588_CYP19A1<sup>amp</sup>).
28112739	Relapsed patients also developed numerous mutations targeting key DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer-associated genes, including GENE_2099_ESR1 and GENE_1588_CYP19A1.
28112739	Notably, GENE_1588_CYP19A1<sup>amp</sup>cells also emerged in vitro, but only in AI-resistant models.
28112739	GENE_1588_CYP19A1 amplification caused increased aromatase activity and estrogen-independent GENE_2099_ERa binding to target genes, resulting in GENE_1588_CYP19A1<sup>amp</sup>cells showing decreased sensitivity to AI treatment.
28112739	These data suggest that AI treatment itself selects for acquired GENE_1588_CYP19A1<sup>amp</sup>and promotes local autocrine estrogen signaling in AI-resistant metastatic patients.
28115068	The role of oxidative stress in DNA damage in pancreatic b cells induced by CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate.
28115068	CHEMICAL__Di_2_ethyhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP) is commonly used as a plasticizer, which loosely binds to plastic materials and easily leaches out of these products and enters into the environment.
28115068	Exposure to CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP can impair pancreatic beta cells (GENE_2305_INS_1  cells)function, which is associated with Insulin Resistance (IR) and type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes.
28115068	However, the mechanism of how CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP leads to Insulin Resistance is unknown.
28115068	Our results showed that the cell viability of GENE_2305_INS_1  cells exposed to CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP (0-1600   M) were decreased in a concentration-dependent manner.
28115068	CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP caused significant increases of DNA migration and oxidative damage in GENE_2305_INS_1  cells.
28115068	Lysosomal membrane permeability was increased and mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced after GENE_2305_INS_1  cells treated with CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP.
28115068	CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP was also shown to induce ROS production and cause CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH depletion in GENE_2305_INS_1  cells.
28115068	CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP brought a significant decrease in super CHEMICAL_25741_oxide dismutase (SOD) and led to accumulation of CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) in the GENE_2305_INS_1  cells.
28115068	CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP increased significantly the expression of GENE_7157_P53 and GENE_472_ATM gene of GENE_2305_INS_1  cell at high dose levels.
28115068	Simultaneously, CHEMICAL_D045542_Pyrroloquinoline_Quinone (CHEMICAL_18315_PQQ), an antioxidant, and CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol were used in the study to determine their effects on CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP-induced GENE_2305_INS_1  cells damage.
28115068	CHEMICAL_18315_PQQ could protect the GENE_2305_INS_1  cells from the damage induced by CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP to some extent, while CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol aggravated the toxic effects of CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP.
28115068	These results indicate that CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP-mediated GENE_2305_INS_1  cell dysfunction through a lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway, involving oxidative stress and GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_472_ATM activation.
28115273	Ablation of GENE_10090)_Akt2 prevents CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D009202_myocardial_mitochondrial_injury and contractile dysfunction: Role of GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28115273	UNASSIGNED: CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat is a quaternary CHEMICAL_D009584_nitrogen herbicide triggering oxidative stress, DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage and multi-organ injuries including hearts.
28115273	To date, effective measure to combat DISEASE_D064420_paraquat_toxicity is still lacking.
28115273	Recent evidence has revealed a role for GENE_10090)_Akt in cardiac homeostasis.
28115273	To this end, this study was designed to examine the role of GENE_10090)_Akt2 in acute CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat exposure-induced cardiac contractile and mitochondrial injury using a unique SPECIES_10090_murine model of GENE_10090)_Akt2 knockout.
28115273	Cardiac contractile and intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ properties were evaluated.
28115273	Mitochondrial integrity, ROS production, lipid peroxidation, ER stress and apoptosis were evaluated using aconitase assay, CHEMICAL_C102006_citrate synthase activity, CHEMICAL__DHE staining, mitochondrial permeation pore opening, CHEMICAL_C027576_4_hydroxy_nonenal (CHEMICAL__4_HNE) and Western blot.
28115273	Our results revealed compromised echocardiographic, contractile and intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ handling properties along with overt DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage (reduced levels of GENE_10090)_PGC_1a, aconitase, GENE_10090)_citrate_synthase activity and CHEMICAL_D009243_NAD_) in SPECIES_10090_mice challenged with CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat (45mg/kg, single injection, i.p.
28115273	), the effects of which were attenuated by GENE_10090)_Akt ablation.
28115273	CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat triggered CHEMICAL_D013481_O2_ production, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis as evidenced by increased DHE staining, CHEMICAL__4_HNE, GENE_10090)_caspase_3 activity, GENE_10090)_Bax and reduced GENE_10090)_Bcl_2 levels in association with unchanged ER stress.
28115273	The redox signaling molecule GENE_10090)_nuclear_factor_erythroid_related_factor_2 (GENE_10090)_Nrf2) was upregulated in response to CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat challenge.
28115273	Findings from in vitro study revealed that stimulation of GENE_10090)_Nrf2 using CHEMICAL_C016766_sulforaphane (10 M) negated GENE_10090)_Akt2 ablation-offered beneficial effect against CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat whereas inhibition of GENE_10090)_Nrf2 using CHEMICAL_D047311_luteolin (20 M) mimicked GENE_10090)_Akt2 ablation-induced beneficial effect against CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat challenge.
28115273	Taken together, our data indicate that GENE_10090)_Akt2 ablation may protect against DISEASE_D064420_paraquat_toxicity-induced cardiac contractile defect and apoptosis possibly via regulation of GENE_10090)_Nrf2 activation and mitochondrial homeostasis.
28115640	CHEMICAL_D003000_Clonidine Induces Apoptosis of SPECIES_9606_Human Corneal Epithelial Cells through Death Receptors-Mediated, Mitochondria-Dependent Signaling Pathway.
28115640	CHEMICAL_D003000_Clonidine, an a2-adrenoreceptor agonist, is an anti-DISEASE_D005901_glaucoma drug clinically used in many developing countries, and its abuse might damage the DISEASE_D065306_cornea and impair SPECIES_9606_human vision.
28115640	However, its DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and precise mechanisms need to be elucidated.
28115640	Herein, we investigated the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine and its underlying mechanisms, using an in vitro model of SPECIES_9606_human corneal epithelial (HCEP) cells and an in vivo model of cat corneas, respectively.
28115640	HCEP cells were treated with various doses of CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine for 1-28   h, resulting in abnormal morphology, decline of cell viability and G1 phase arrest in a time- and/or dose-dependent manner.
28115640	Moreover, CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine treatment induced elevation of plasma membrane permeability, CHEMICAL__phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation in HCEP cells.
28115640	Furthermore, we found that CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine treatment resulted in activated GENE_835;836;841;842_caspase_2_3_8_and_9, disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, downregulation of GENE_596_Bcl_2, and upregulation of Bad, cytoplasmic GENE_54205_cytochrome_c and apoptosis inducing factor, suggesting that CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine-induced apoptosis is triggered through Fas/GENE_7132_TNFR1 death receptors and GENE_596_Bcl_2 family proteins-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathways.
28115640	Finally, our in vivo results displayed that 0.25% CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine could induce DNA fragmentation of cat corneal epithelial cells.
28115640	In summary, our findings suggest that CHEMICAL_D003000_clonidine above 1/32 of its clinical therapeutic dosage is cytotoxic to corneal epithelial cells by inducing cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, and its pro-apoptotic effect on HCEP cells is triggered by a Fas/GENE_7132_TNFR1 death receptors-mediated, mitochondria-dependent signaling pathway.
28115641	Endocrine Activity of CHEMICAL__AVB, CHEMICAL__2MR, CHEMICAL_D002083_BHA, and Their Mixtures.
28115641	Personal care products are used increasingly, resulting in growing concern concerning their potential disruption of normal hormonal functions.
28115641	Recent results on the bioaccumulation of cosmetic ingredients in wildlife and SPECIES_9606_humans point to the need for an in-depth analysis for endocrine activity, in particular with respect to their influence on the CHEMICAL_50113_androgen (AR), glucocorticoid (GR), and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs).
28115641	Furthermore, SPECIES_9606_humans are commonly exposed simultaneously to complex mixtures of endocrine active compounds.
28115641	We have therefore examined 3 frequently used cosmetic ingredients: CHEMICAL_C049083_2_methylresorcinol (CHEMICAL__2MR), CHEMICAL_D002083_butylated_hydroxyanisole (CHEMICAL_D002083_BHA) and CHEMICAL_C049935_avobenzone (CHEMICAL__AVB), for (anti)-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-, (anti)-glucocorticoid-, and (anti)-thyroid hormone-like activities.
28115641	Their binary and ternary mixtures at EC50 or IC50 concentrations have also been examined for anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-, glucocorticoid-, and thyroid hormone-like activities.
28115641	In the SPECIES_9606_MDA_kb2 reporter cell line, compounds possessed anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-, glucocorticoid-, and anti-glucocorticoid-like activities (except CHEMICAL__AVB).
28115641	A new cell line, GH3.TRE-Luc, was used to evaluate anti-thyroid and thyroid hormone-like activities.
28115641	The combinations CHEMICAL__2MR + CHEMICAL_D002083_BHA and CHEMICAL__2MR + CHEMICAL_D002083_BHA + CHEMICAL__AVB have glucocorticoid-like activity: only CHEMICAL__2MR + CHEMICAL__AVB has anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-like activity.
28115641	On the other hand, binary and ternary mixtures of compounds showed no thyroid hormone-like activity.
28115641	Thus, in addition to identifying new endocrine disrupting compounds, it is also necessary to determine the effects of their mixtures in order to assess fully their risk to SPECIES_9606_human health.
28115650	Ion-shedding CHEMICAL_D015034_zinc_oxide nanoparticles induce microglial BV2 cell proliferation via the GENE_5594_ERK and Akt signaling pathways.
28115650	UNASSIGNED: Given the wide application of CHEMICAL_D015034_zinc_oxide nanoparticles (CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs), the health hazards of these particles have attracted extensive worldwide attention.
28115650	Many more studies on the biological interactions of CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs have been performed in recent years.
28115650	In this study, we focused on the biological effects on BV2 microglial cells induced by CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs at non- or sub-toxic concentrations.
28115650	We found that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs at a concentration of 5    g/ml could significantly activate cell proliferation, while CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs at other concentrations did not.
28115650	We also found that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs induced microglial cell activation in a time-dependent manner.
28115650	Moreover, a potent increase in the ratio of cells in S phase at all CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs concentrations was observed in a cell cycle analysis.
28115650	Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and immunocytochemistry techniques, we demonstrated that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO dissolution could occur in the culture medium and in the lysosomes of BV2 cells.
28115650	CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs significantly induced the phosphorylation of GENE_5594_ERK and Akt, which might be involved in promoting cell proliferation.
28115650	In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs induced BV2 microglial cell proliferation probably via the release of CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc ions from CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO, which could then activate the GENE_5594_ERK and Akt signaling pathways.
28119078	Modulation of immunological activity on macrophages induced by CHEMICAL_D003976_diazinon.
28119078	CHEMICAL_D003976_Diazinon is an CHEMICAL_D010755_organophosphorus (OP) insecticide and is widely used not only in agriculture but also homes and garden in Japan.
28119078	CHEMICAL_D003976_Diazinon has been reported to increase GENE_7124_TNF_a production in rat serum and brain, suggesting that it can modify the proinflammatory response.
28119078	In this study, we investigated the effects of CHEMICAL_D003976_diazinon on macrophage functions, such as cytokine production, reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation, GENE_10090)_cyclooxygenase_COX_2 and GENE_10090)_inducible_nitric_oxide_synthase (GENE_10090)_iNOS) expressions, cell-surface molecule expressions, and phagocytosis in RAW264.7 cells.
28119078	In RAW264.7 cells, CHEMICAL_D003976_diazinon induced the production of GENE_10090)_TNF_a and GENE_10090)_IL_6.
28119078	CHEMICAL_D003976_Diazinon induced ROS generation and the expressions of GENE_10090)_COX_2, GENE_10090)_iNOS, and cell-surface molecules GENE_10090)_CD40, GENE_10090)_CD86, and MHC class II, but reduced phagocytic activity in RAW264.7 cells.
28119078	ERK and GENE_10090)_p38, but not JNK and GENE_10090)_p65 were involved in CHEMICAL_D003976_diazinon-induced GENE_10090)_IL_6 expression in RAW264.7 cells.
28119078	We also examined these proinflammatory responses in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells.
28119078	These results suggested that CHEMICAL_D003976_diazinon can activate macrophages and enhance inflammatory responses.
28119079	CHEMICAL_C017180_Deltamethrin increases the fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and SPECIES_6239_Caenorhabditis_elegans.
28119079	Research has shown that CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin, a Type-I pyrethroid, increases CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride (fat) accumulation in adipocytes.
28119079	Little is known, however, about any similar effect of CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin, a Type-II CHEMICAL__pyrethroid, which produces a distinct syndrome of DISEASE_D011041_poisoning in mammals compared with CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin.
28119079	This study was therefore aimed to explore the role of CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin on fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and SPECIES_6239_Caenorhabditis_elegans.
28119079	CHEMICAL_C017180_Deltamethrin (10  M) significantly increased the fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and wild type SPECIES_6239_C_elegans compared to respective controls.
28119079	CHEMICAL_C017180_Deltamethrin decreased the ratio of CHEMICAL__phosphorylated_AMP-activated kinase (pAMPKa) over AMPKa and CHEMICAL__phosphorylated_acetyl_CoA carboxylase (ACC) over ACC, while it increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPa) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPARy) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
28119079	Similarly, CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin potentiated fat accumulation in SPECIES_6239_C_elegans without affecting growth or pharyngeal pumping rate.
28119079	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin significantly reduced the total progeny number and locomotive activities in SPECIES_6239_C_elegans in a dose-dependent manner.
28119079	CHEMICAL_C017180_Deltamethrin increased fat accumulation via GENE_6239)_aak_2 (an ortholog of AMPKa) and GENE_6239)_nhr_49 (a homolog of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a and also downstream target of GENE_6239)_aak_2) mediated mechanisms.
28119079	The current work is the first report of the effects of CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin on increased fat storage by 3T3- L1 adipocytes and SPECIES_6239_C_elegans via GENE_6239)_aak_2 (AMPKa ortholog)-mediated mechanism.
28123000	Dual Role of GENE_10090)_Epidermal_Growth_Factor_Receptor in DISEASE_D056486_Liver_Injury and Regeneration after CHEMICAL__Acetaminophen_Overdose in SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28123000	GENE_1956_Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR) plays a crucial role in hepatocyte proliferation.
28123000	Its role in CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen (CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP)-mediated hepatotoxicity and subsequent DISEASE_D008107_liver_regeneration is completely unknown.
28123000	Role of GENE_10090)_EGFR after CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-DISEASE_D062787_overdose in SPECIES_10090_mice was studied using pharmacological inhibition strategy.
28123000	Rapid, sustained and dose-dependent activation of GENE_10090)_EGFR was noted after CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-treatment in SPECIES_10090_mice, which was triggered by CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione depletion.
28123000	GENE_1956_EGFR-activation was also observed in primary SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes after CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-treatment, preceding elevation of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity markers.
28123000	Treatment of SPECIES_10090_mice with an GENE_1956_EGFR-inhibitor (EGFRi), CHEMICAL_C420268_Canertinib, 1h post-CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP resulted in robust inhibition of GENE_10090)_EGFR-activation and a striking reduction in CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28123000	Metabolic activation of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP, formation of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-protein adducts, CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-mediated JNK-activation and its mitochondrial translocation were not altered by EGFRi.
28123000	Interestingly, GENE_1956_EGFR rapidly translocated to mitochondria after CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-treatment.
28123000	EGFRi-treatment abolished mitochondrial GENE_1956_EGFR activity, prevented CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative-stress and release of endonucleases from mitochondria, which are responsible for DNA-damage/DISEASE_D009336_necrosis.
28123000	Treatment with CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC), 4h post-CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP in SPECIES_10090_mice did not show any protection but treatment of EGFRi in combination with CHEMICAL__NAC showed decrease in DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28123000	Finally, delayed treatment with EGFRi, 12-h post-CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP, did not alter peak injury but caused impairment of DISEASE_D008107_liver_regeneration resulting in DISEASE_D014947_sustained_injury and decreased survival after CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP DISEASE_D062787_overdose in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28123000	Impairment of regeneration was due to inhibition of GENE_595_cyclinD1 induction and cell cycle arrest.
28123000	Our study has revealed a new dual role of GENE_1956_EGFR both in initiation of DISEASE_D014947_APAP_injury and in stimulation of subsequent compensatory regeneration after CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-DISEASE_D062787_overdose.
28123100	Hepatic Detoxification of CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A is CHEMICAL_26537_Retinoid-Dependent.
28123100	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL_C006780_2_2_bis_4_hydroxyphenyl_propane) is a widely used industrial chemical.
28123100	The extensive distribution of CHEMICAL__BPA in the environment poses risks to humans.
28123100	However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CHEMICAL__BPA toxicity as well as its effective detoxification and elimination are not well understood.
28123100	We have investigated specifically for CHEMICAL__BPA the notion raised in the literature that the optimal sensing, detoxification, and elimination of xenobiotics requires CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid (natural derivatives and synthetic analogs of CHEMICAL_D014801_vitamin_A) actions.
28123100	The objective of the study was to explore how CHEMICAL_D012176_retinoids, both those stored in the liver and those originating from recent oral intake, help maintain an optimal xenobiotic detoxification response, affecting mRNA expression and activities of elements of xenobiotic detoxification system upon CHEMICAL__BPA administration to mice.
28123100	Wild-type and mice lacking hepatic CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid stores (Lrat-/-) were acutely treated with CHEMICAL__BPA (50   mg/kg body weight), with or without oral supplementation with CHEMICAL_C009166_retinyl_acetate.
28123100	Hepatic mRNA expression levels of the genes encoding nuclear receptors and their downstream targets involved in xenobiotic biotransformation, phase I and phase II enzyme activities, and levels of oxidative damage to cellular proteins and lipids in hepatic microsomes, mitochondria and cytosol, were assessed.
28123100	CHEMICAL__BPA treatment induced hepatic activities needed for its detoxification and elimination in wild-type mice.
28123100	However, CHEMICAL__BPA failed to induce these activities in the livers of Lrat-/- mice.
28123100	Oral supplementation with CHEMICAL_C009166_retinyl_acetate restored phase I and phase II enzyme activities, but accelerated CHEMICAL__BPA-induced oxidative damage through enhancement of non-mitochondrial ROS production.
28123100	Thus, the activities of the enzymes involved in the hepatic elimination of CHEMICAL__BPA require hepatic CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid stores.
28123100	The extent of hepatic damage that arises from acute CHEMICAL__BPA intoxication is directly affected by CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid administration during the period of CHEMICAL__BPA exposure and hepatic CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid stores that have accumulated over the lifetime of the organism.
28119166	In vitro toxicological evaluation of CHEMICAL_C066471_NCS_382, a high-affinity antagonist of CHEMICAL__y_hydroxybutyrate (CHEMICAL_30830_GHB) binding.
28119166	CHEMICAL__y_Hydroxybutyric_acid (CHEMICAL_30830_GHB), a minor metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA, can accumulate to significant concentrations in the heritable disorder of CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA degradation, GENE_7915_succinic_semialdehyde_dehydrogenase (GENE_7915_SSADH) deficiency (SSADHD).
28119166	Moreover, CHEMICAL_30830_GHB may be employed in therapeutic settings (treatment of DISEASE_D009290_narcolepsy), as well as instances of illicit activity, including acquaintance sexual assault and the induction of euphoria.
28119166	High-affinity binding sites for CHEMICAL_30830_GHB in the brain have been identified, although the absolute identity of these receptors remains unclear.
28119166	Pharmacological antagonism of CHEMICAL_30830_GHB binding may have multiple instances of therapeutic relevance.
28119166	The high affinity CHEMICAL_30830_GHB receptor antagonist, CHEMICAL_C066471_NCS_382 (CHEMICAL__6_7_8_9_tetrahydro_5_hydroxy_5H_benzo_cyclohept_6_ylideneacetic_acid) has not been piloted in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28119166	To address the potential clinical utility of CHEMICAL_C066471_NCS_382, we have piloted initial studies of its toxicology in HepG2 and primary hepatocyte cells.
28119166	At high dose (0.5mM), CHEMICAL_C066471_NCS_382 showed no capacity for inhibition of microsomal CYPs (GENE_1544_CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) and minimal potential for activation of xenobiotic nuclear receptors.
28119166	Additional cellular integrity and functional assays (viability, oxidative stress, apoptosis, CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production) revealed little evidence for DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, and a DISEASE_D009800_low_degree_of_dysregulation of >370 genes actively engaged in the mediation of cellular DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28119166	In vitro testing indicates a low probability of cellular DISEASE_D064420_toxicity associated with CHEMICAL_C066471_NCS_382.
28119452	MicroRNA-375 Is Induced in CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity to Repress GENE_6928_Hepatocyte_Nuclear_Factor_1_b.
28119452	Nephrotoxicity is a major adverse effect of CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-mediated chemotherapy in cancer SPECIES_9606_patients.
28119452	The pathogenesis of CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remains largely unclear, making it difficult to design effective renoprotective approaches.
28119452	Here, we have examined the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
28119452	We show that CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin nephrotoxicity was not affected by overall depletion of both beneficial and detrimental miRNAs from kidney proximal tubular cells in SPECIES_10090_mice in which the miRNA-generating enzyme Dicer had been conditionally knocked out.
28119452	To identify miRNAs involved in CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin nephrotoxicity, we used microarray analysis to profile miRNA expression and identified 47 up-regulated microRNAs and 20 down-regulated microRNAs in kidney cortical tissues.
28119452	One up-regulated miRNA was GENE_494324_miR_375, whose expression was also induced in CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-treated renal tubular cells.
28119452	Interestingly, inhibition of GENE_494324_miR_375 decreased CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that GENE_494324_miR_375 is a cell-damaging or pro-apoptotic agent.
28119452	Blockade of GENE_7157_P53 or NF-kB attenuated CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced GENE_494324_miR_375 expression, supporting a role of GENE_7157_P53 and NF-kB in GENE_494324_miR_375 induction.
28119452	We also identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B (GENE_6928_HNF_1b) as a key downstream target of GENE_494324_miR_375.
28119452	Of note, we further demonstrated that GENE_6928_HNF_1b protected renal cells against CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
28119452	Together, these results suggest that upon CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin exposure, GENE_7157_P53 and NF-kB collaboratively induce GENE_494324_miR_375 expression, which, in turn, represses GENE_6928_HNF_1b activity, resulting in renal tubular cell apoptosis and nephrotoxicity.
28123099	From the Cover: Teratogenic Effects of in Utero Exposure to CHEMICAL_D004051_Di_2_Ethylhexyl_Phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP) in B6:129S4 SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28123099	CHEMICAL__Intrauterine exposure to CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates is known to cause disorders of male reproductive function including CHEMICAL_D000728_androgen insufficiency, decreased fertility, and germ cell defects in rodents.
28123099	In this study, we set out to investigate the effects of intrauterine exposure to CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP) on fetal development of the B6:129S4 SPECIES_10090_mouse_strain.
28123099	Time-mated pregnant C57BL/6 dams were exposed to 0, 5, 250, or 500   mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP with SPECIES_381124_corn oil as the vehicle via oral gavage from embryonic days (E)7 to 16.
28123099	Survival and gross morphology of the pups were analyzed one day after the last treatment.
28123099	Anogenital distance (AGD) and testicular cell functions were examined in male embryos to confirm the known effects of CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate exposure.
28123099	CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP exposure significantly reduced the survival rate of fetuses in the 250 and 500   mg/kg dosage groups compared with the control and 5   mg/kg groups.
28123099	Exposure to 250 and 500   mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP was teratogenic and induced exencephaly and limb malformations such as polydactyly in the B6:126S4 embryos.
28123099	No gross malformations were observed in control or 5   mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP groups.
28123099	In male embryos, exposure to both 5 and 250   mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP in utero was sufficient to induce the formation of multinucleated germ cells in the testes and widespread changes in mRNA expression of germ cell, interstitium and Sertoli cell-associated genes.
28123099	These findings reveal that intrauterine CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP exposure has a strong teratogenic, and lethal impact on the fetuses of B6:129S4 SPECIES_10090_mouse strain.
28125038	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic Induces GENE_23636_p62 Expression to Form a Positive Feedback Loop with GENE_4780_Nrf2 in SPECIES_9606_Human Epidermal Keratinocytes: Implications for Preventing CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic-Induced Skin Cancer.
28125038	Exposure to inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic in contaminated drinking water poses an environmental public health threat for hundreds of millions of SPECIES_9606_people in the US and around the world.
28125038	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic is a known carcinogen for DISEASE_D012878_skin_cancer.
28125038	However, the mechanism by which CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic induces DISEASE_D012878_skin_cancer remains poorly understood.
28125038	Here, we have shown that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic induces GENE_23636_p62 expression in an autophagy-independent manner in SPECIES_9606_human HaCaT keratinocytes.
28125038	In SPECIES_10090_mouse skin, chronic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure through drinking water increases GENE_10090)_p62 protein levels in the epidermis.
28125038	GENE_10090)_Nrf2 is required for basal and CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced GENE_10090)_p62 up-regulation.
28125038	GENE_10090)_p62 knockdown reduces CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced GENE_10090)_Nrf2 activity, and induces sustained GENE_10090)_p21 up-regulation.
28125038	GENE_10090)_p62 induction is associated with increased proliferation in SPECIES_10090_mouse epidermis.
28125038	GENE_10090)_p62 knockdown had little effect on CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced apoptosis, while it decreased cell proliferation following CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic treatment.
28125038	Our findings indicate that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic induces GENE_23636_p62 expression to regulate the GENE_4780_Nrf2 pathway in SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes and suggest that targeting GENE_23636_p62 may help prevent CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced DISEASE_D012878_skin_cancer.
28126643	Comparative in vitro genotoxicity study of CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO nanoparticles, CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO macroparticles and CHEMICAL_49976_ZnCl2 to MDCK kidney cells: Size matters.
28126643	In the present study, we evaluated the roles that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO particle size and CHEMICAL__Zn ion release have on cyto- and genotoxicity in vitro.
28126643	The Madin-Darby SPECIES_9615_canine kidney (MDCK) cells were treated with CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO nanoparticles (NPs), CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO macroparticles (MPs), and CHEMICAL_49976_ZnCl2 as a source of free CHEMICAL__Zn ions.
28126643	We first tested DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity to define sub-cytotoxic exposure concentrations and afterwards we performed alkaline comet and cytokinesis-block micronucleus assays.
28126643	Additionally, the activities of both catalase (CAT) and CHEMICAL__glutathione_S-transferase (GST) were evaluated in order to examine the potential impairment of cellular stress-defence capacity.
28126643	The amount of dissolved CHEMICAL__Zn ions from CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs in the cell culture medium was evaluated by an optimized voltammetric method.
28126643	The results showed that all the tested CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc compounds induced similar concentration-dependent DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, but only CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs significantly elevated DNA and chromosomal damage, which was accompanied by a reduction of GST and CAT activity.
28126643	Although CHEMICAL__Zn ion release from CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs in cell culture medium was significant, our results show that this reason alone cannot explain the CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO genotoxicity seen in this experiment.
28126643	We discuss that genotoxicity of CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs depends on the particle size, which determines the physical principles of their dissolution and cellular internalisation.
28126411	CHEMICAL_C023036_Perfluorooctanoic_acid affects endocytosis involving GENE_10090)_clathrin_light_chain_A and microRNA-133b-3p in SPECIES_10090_mouse testes.
28126411	CHEMICAL_C023036_Perfluorooctanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA) is an abundant CHEMICAL__perfluoroalkyl substance widely applied in industrial and consumer products.
28126411	Among its potential health hazards, testicular DISEASE_D064420_toxicity is of major concern.
28126411	To explore the potential effect of miRNA on post-translational regulation after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposure, changes in miRNAs were detected via miRNA array.
28126411	Seventeen miRNAs were differentially expressed (eight upregulated, nine downregulated) in male SPECIES_10090_mouse testes after exposure to 5mg/kg/d of CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA for 28d (>1.5-fold and P<0.05 compared with the control).
28126411	Eight of these miRNAs were further selected for TaqMan qPCR analysis.
28126411	Proteomic profile analysis indicated that many changed proteins after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment, including GENE_10090)_intersectin_1 (GENE_10090)_ITSN1), GENE_10090)_serine_protease_inhibitor_A3K (GENE_10090)_Serpina3k), and GENE_10090)_apolipoprotein_a1 (GENE_10090)_APOA1), were involved in endocytosis and blood-testis barrier (BTB) processes.
28126411	These changes were further verified by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses.
28126411	Endocytosis-related genes were selected for qPCR analysis, with many found to be significantly changed after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment, including GENE_10090)_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor_pathway_substrate_8 (GENE_10090)_Eps8), GENE_10090)_Eps15, GENE_10090)_cortactin, cofilin, espin, GENE_10090)_vinculin, and zyxin.
28126411	We further predicted the potential interaction between changed miRNAs and proteins, which indicated that miRNAs might play a role in the post-translational regulation of gene expression after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment in SPECIES_10090_mouse testes.
28126411	Among them, miR-133b-3p/GENE_10090)_clathrin_light_chain_A (GENE_10090)_CLTA) was selected and verified in vitro by transfection and luciferase activity assay.
28126411	Results showed that CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposure affects endocytosis in SPECIES_10090_mouse testes and that GENE_10090)_CLTA is a potential target of miR-133b-3p.
28130038	Autophagy contributes to CHEMICAL_C585745_4_Amino_2_Trifluoromethyl_Phenyl_Retinate-induced differentiation in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D015473_acute_promyelocytic_leukemia SPECIES_9606_NB4 cells.
28130038	As a classic differentiation agent, CHEMICAL_D014212_all_trans_retinoic_acid (CHEMICAL__ATRA) has been widely used in treatment of DISEASE_D015473_acute_promyelocytic_leukemia (DISEASE_D015473_APL).
28130038	However, clinical application of CHEMICAL__ATRA has limitations.
28130038	Our previous studies suggested that CHEMICAL_C585745_4_Amino_2_Trifluoromethyl_Phenyl_Retinate (CHEMICAL__ATPR), a novel CHEMICAL_D014212_all_trans_retinoic_acid (CHEMICAL__ATRA) derivative designed and synthesized by our team, could induce differentiation of DISEASE_D015473_APL cells in vivo and in vitro.
28130038	To explore the underlying mechanism of CHEMICAL__ATPR, the effect of CHEMICAL__ATPR on autophagy of DISEASE_D015473_APL cells was observed in the present study.
28130038	The results showed that the differentiation effect of CHEMICAL__ATPR on DISEASE_D015473_APL cells was accompanied with autophagy induction and PML-RARa degradation via activating GENE_4851_Notch1 signaling pathway.
28130038	Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using CHEMICAL_C025946_3_methyladenine (CHEMICAL_C025946_3_MA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets essential autophagy gene GENE_9474_ATG5 abrogated the CHEMICAL__ATPR-induced cell differentiation.
28130038	Furthermore, when pretreated with CHEMICAL_C028145_DAPT, a y-secretase inhibitor, the GENE_4851_Notch1 signaling pathway was blocked in DISEASE_D015473_APL cells, followed by the reduction of CHEMICAL__ATPR-induced autophagy and differentiation.
28130038	Taken together, these results suggested that autophagy play an important role in CHEMICAL__ATPR-induced cell differentiation, which may provide a novel approach to cure DISEASE_D015473_APL SPECIES_9606_patients.
28131803	GENE_10090)_MyD88 gene knockout attenuates CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_acute_lung_injury.
28131803	OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the role of GENE_10090)_myeloid_differentiation_factor_88 (GENE_10090)_MyD88) in CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_acute_lung_injury (DISEASE_D055371_ALI).
28131803	METHODS: C57BL SPECIES_10090_mice were divided into the control group, CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat group, GENE_10090)_MyD88 knockout (KO) group, and GENE_10090)_MyD88 KO plus CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat group.
28131803	At 48h after CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat poisoning, serum and lung tissues were collected.
28131803	ELISA was employed to detect GENE_10090)_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_10090)_TNF_a) and interleukine-1b (GENE_10090)_IL_1b) contents in serum.
28131803	Lung tissues were processed for CHEMICAL_D006416_hematoxylin-CHEMICAL_D004801_eosin staining, followed by histological scoring.
28131803	PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of GENE_10090)_MyD88, GENE_10090)_TNF_a, and GENE_10090)_IL_1b in the lungs.
28131803	Immunofluorescence staining was done to evaluate the expression and distribution of GENE_10090)_MyD88 and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) in the lungs.
28131803	Western blotting was conducted to detect the protein level of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, GENE_10090)_TLR9, GENE_10090)_MyD88, and NF-kB in the lungs.
28131803	RESULTS: CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat poisoning significantly increased serum inflammatory cytokines, as well as GENE_10090)_MyD88, GENE_10090)_TLR4, GENE_10090)_TLR9, and NF-kB, and resulted in DISEASE_D055371_ALI.
28131803	After GENE_10090)_MyD88 KO, the levels of inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB decreased markedly, and DISEASE_D055371_ALI was also attenuated although GENE_10090)_TLR4 and GENE_10090)_TLR9 expression continued at an elevated level.
28131803	CONCLUSION: GENE_10090)_MyD88 mediates CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI, and GENE_10090)_MyD88 gene knockout may attenuate CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI and reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
28132806	CHEMICAL_D012293_Rifampicin pre-treatment inhibits the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced PC12 cells by enhancing sumoylation modification of a-synuclein.
28132806	Our previous research revealed that CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin could protect PC12 (DISEASE_D010673_pheochromocytoma 12)  cells from CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity by reversing the aggregation of a-synuclein.
28132806	Furthermore, increasing evidence indicated that the misfolded a-synuclein with SUMOylation, an important protein posttranslational modification, was easier to solubilize and was less toxic.
28132806	Here, we investigated whether CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin could stabilize a-synuclein and prevent CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced PC12  cells from undergoing apoptosis by enhancing SUMOylation of a-synuclein.
28132806	The expression of GENE_10116)_SUMO1 and GENE_10116)_SUMO2/3, the two main proteins responsible for the SUMOylation modification in PC12  cells, were detected by western blotting.
28132806	Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to compare qualitatively the SUMOylation modification of a-synuclein.
28132806	The cell viability and apoptosis rate were measured by a CCK-8 assay kit and flow cytometry, respectively.
28132806	We targeted GENE_7329_Ubc9 as a key enzyme in the SUMOylation modification pathway and knocked down the GENE_7329_UBC9 gene using a short interfering RNA.
28132806	Treatment with 150   mol/L CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin, increased the expressions of GENE_7341_SUMO1 and GENE_6613_SUMO2/3 in cells by 1.5 times compared with the control group; meanwhile, the cell viability of CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced cells increased from 20 to 80% (P  <  0.05).
28132806	In addition, the increased SUMOylation activity in the cells stimulated by CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin was observed 18  h earlier compared with cells treated by CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone alone.
28132806	SUMOylation of a-synuclein was more significant in CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin-treated cells and GENE_7329_Ubc9 upregulated cells.
28132806	However, the same phenomenon and the protective effect of CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin were reversed after GENE_7329_UBC9 knockout.
28132806	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin might reduce the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced PC12  cells by promoting SUMOylation of a-synuclein.

28131861	BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Cytochrome P450 2A5 (GENE_10090)_CYP2A5) is induced by CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol, and the CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol induction of GENE_10090)_CYP2A5 is regulated by GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2 (GENE_4780_NRF2).

28131861	This study investigates the relationship between the GENE_10090)_PPARa-GENE_10090)_FGF21 axis and the enhanced DISEASE_D005235_alcoholic_fatty_liver in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	METHODS: SPECIES_10090_Mice were fed the Lieber-Decarli CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol diet to induce DISEASE_D005235_alcoholic_fatty_liver.
28131861	RESULTS: More severe DISEASE_D005235_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease was developed in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice than in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>+/+</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	Basal GENE_10090)_FGF21 levels were higher in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice than in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>+/+</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice, but CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol did not further increase the elevated GENE_10090)_FGF21 levels in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice while GENE_10090)_FGF21 was induced by CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol in GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>+/+</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	Basal levels of serum GENE_10090)_FGF21 were lower in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice than in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>+/+</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice; CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol induced GENE_10090)_FGF21 in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>+/+</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice but not in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice, whereas CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol induced DISEASE_D015228_hypertriglyceridemia in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice but not in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>+/+</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	Administration of recombinant GENE_10090)_FGF21 normalized serum GENE_10090)_FGF21 and CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride in GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	DISEASE_D005235_Alcoholic_fatty_liver was enhanced in liver-specific GENE_10090)_Fgf21 knockout SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	GENE_10090)_Ppara and GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5 double knockout (GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>-/-</sup>/GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>-/-</sup>) SPECIES_10090_mice developed more severe DISEASE_D005235_alcoholic_fatty_liver than GENE_10090)_Ppara<sup>+/+</sup>/GENE_10090)_Cyp2a5<sup>-/-</sup>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28131861	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GENE_10090)_CYP2A5 protects against the development of DISEASE_D005235_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease, and the GENE_5465_PPARa-GENE_26291_FGF21 axis contributes to the protective effects of GENE_10090)_CYP2A5 on DISEASE_D005235_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease.
28137510	Influence of CHEMICAL_15693_aldose reductase on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signaling in lens epithelial cells.
28137510	DISEASE_D002386_Cataract is the most frequent cause of DISEASE_D001766_blindness worldwide and is treated by surgical removal of the opaque lens to restore the light path to the retina.
28137510	While DISEASE_D002386_cataract surgery is a safe procedure, some SPECIES_9606_patients develop a complication of the surgery involving opacification and wrinkling of the posterior lens capsule.
28137510	This process, called DISEASE_D058442_posterior_capsule_opacification (DISEASE_D058442_PCO), requires a second clinical treatment that can in turn lead to additional complications.
28137510	Prevention of DISEASE_D058442_PCO is a current unmet need in the vision care enterprise.
28137510	The pathogenesis of DISEASE_D058442_PCO involves the transition of lens epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype, designated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
28137510	Our previous studies showed that SPECIES_10090_transgenic_mice designed for overexpression of SPECIES_9606_human CHEMICAL_15693_aldose reductase developed DISEASE_D007905_lens_defects reminiscent of DISEASE_D058442_PCO.
28137510	In the current study, we evaluated the impact of GENE_231_aldose_reductase (GENE_231_AR) on expression of expression of EMT markers in the lens.
28137510	Primary lens epithelial cells from DISEASE_C536415_AR-SPECIES_10090_transgenic_mice showed downregulated expression of GENE_10090)_Foxe3 and GENE_10090)_Pax6 and increased expression of GENE_10090)_a_SMA, GENE_10090)_fibronectin and GENE_10090)_snail, a pattern of gene expression typical of cells undergoing EMT.
28137510	A role for GENE_231_AR in these changes was further confirmed when we observed that they could be normalized by treatment of cells with CHEMICAL_C026411_Sorbinil, an GENE_231_AR inhibitor.
28137510	Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways are known to contribute to EMT.
28137510	Interestingly, GENE_231_AR overexpression induced GENE_5594_ERK but not GENE_4087_Smad_2 activation.
28137510	These results suggest that elevation of GENE_231_AR may lead to activation of GENE_5594_ERK signaling and thus play a role in TGF-b/Smad independent induction of EMT in lens epithelial cells.
28137607	Anti-inflammatory effect of Capuli cherry against LPS-induced cytotoxic damage in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
28137607	Capuli cherry (Prunus serotina Ehr.
28137607	subsp.
28137607	capuli (SPECIES_10537_Cav.)
28137607	McVaugh) fruits from the inter-Andean region of Ecuador were analysed to determine their bioactive compounds content, total antioxidant capacity, radical scavenging activity and their anti-inflammatory and protective effects against the cytotoxic damage mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages.
28137607	Capuli fruits proved to be a natural source of bioactive compounds such as CHEMICAL_D000872_anthocyanins, CHEMICAL_D001205_vitamin_C and CHEMICAL__b_carotene as well as to present an important total antioxidant capacity and radical scavenging activities.
28137607	RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated with different concentration of Capuli crude extract and subsequently activated by LPS to determine the markers related to oxidative damage and the proinflammatory cytokine production.
28137607	The markers of oxidative damage, CHEMICAL_16301_nitrite levels, the GENE_3553_interleukin_1b messenger RNA levels and the DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor a mRNA levels and secretion were significantly decreased after the pre-incubated with Capuli extract and subsequently stimulated with LPS.
28137607	In summary, Capuli extract attenuated the LPS-induced damage in RAW 264.7 macrophages due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, showing that Capuli fruits may represent a relevant source of bioactive compounds with promising benefits for SPECIES_9606_human health.
28137608	Silymarin protects against CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity via GENE_10116)_Nrf2 signalling in PC12 cells.
28137608	CHEMICAL_D012838_Silymarin (SM) is a well-known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-DISEASE_D009369_cancer compound extracted from the SPECIES_92921_milk_thistle.
28137608	Here, we investigated the protective effect of SM against CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide (AA)-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity, mainly caused by oxidative stress, via activation of the nuclear transcription factor E2-related factor 2 (GENE_10116)_Nrf2) signalling pathway in PC12  cells.
28137608	The CHEMICAL_53233_MTT reduction assay was used to measure cell viability in various drug-treated groups and demonstrated that SM could increase cell viability in AA-treated PC12  cells.
28137608	We then measured the reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) levels by the CHEMICAL_44785_peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe CHEMICAL_C029569_DCFH_DA and intracellular CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH) and CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) levels by absorption spectrophotometry.
28137608	Our data revealed that SM could reduce ROS and CHEMICAL_566274_MDA levels and increase CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels in AA-induced PC12  cells.
28137608	To identify a potential mechanism for SM-induced protection, we measured the mRNA and protein expression levels of GENE_10116)_Nrf2 and its downstream target antioxidants CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), GENE_10116)_glutamate_cysteine_ligase_catalytic_subunit_GCLC_ and GENE_10116)_glutamate_cysteine_ligase_modifier_subunit (GENE_10116)_GCLM) by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.
28137608	The results suggested that SM could activate GENE_10116)_Nrf2 signalling and increase the expression of GENE_10116)_Nrf2, Gpx, GENE_10116)_GCLC and GENE_10116)_GCLM in AA-treated PC12  cells.
28137608	In conclusion, SM can effectively alleviate AA-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in PC12  cells.
28143724	Effects of chronic CHEMICAL_C023036_perfluorooctanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA) at low concentration on morphometrics, gene expression, and fecundity in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio).
28143724	CHEMICAL_C023036_Perfluorooctanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA) is a persistent, toxic, anthropogenic chemical recalcitrant to biodegradation.
28143724	Based on previous studies in lower and higher vertebrates, it was hypothesized that chronic, sub-lethal, embryonic exposure to CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) would adversely impact SPECIES_7955_fish development, survival, and fecundity.
28143724	SPECIES_7955_Zebrafish SPECIES_6239_embryo/sac-fry were water exposed to 2.0 or 0nM CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA from 3 to 120hpf, and juvenile to adult cohorts were fed spiked food (8 pM) until 6 months.
28143724	After chronic exposure, CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposed SPECIES_7955_fish were significantly smaller in total weight and length.
28143724	Gene expression analysis found a significant decrease of transporters GENE_11309_slco2b1, GENE_28231_slco4a1, GENE_28232_slco3a1 and tgfb1a, and a significant increase of slco1d1 expression.
28143724	CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposed SPECIES_7955_fish produced significantly fewer eggs with reduced viability and developmental stage delay in F<sub>1</sub>.
28143724	Chronic, low-dose exposure of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish to CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA significantly altered normal development, survival and fecundity and would likely impact wild SPECIES_7955_fish population fitness in watersheds chronically exposed to CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA.
28143888	Divergent Mechanisms Leading to Signaling Dysfunction in Embryonic Muscle by CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A and CHEMICAL_C020806_Tetrabromobisphenol_A.
28143888	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and its brominated derivative CHEMICAL_C020806_tetrabromobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TBBPA) are high production volume chemicals used in the manufacture of various consumer products.
28143888	Although regarded as endocrine disruptors, these chemicals are suspected to exert nongenomic actions on muscle function that are not well understood.
28143888	Using skeletal muscle microsomes, we examined the effects of CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__TBBPA on CHEMICAL_D012433_ryanodine receptor type 1 (GENE_6261_RyR1), CHEMICAL_C038806_dihydropyridine receptor (GENE_779_DHPR), and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase (SERCA).
28143888	We assessed the impact of these chemicals on Ca<sup>2+</sup>dynamics and signaling in DISEASE_D020964_embryonic_skeletal_myotubes through fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup>imaging and measurement of resting membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>).
28143888	CHEMICAL__TBBPA activated GENE_6261_RyR1 and inhibited GENE_779_DHPR and SERCA, inducing a net efflux of Ca<sup>2+</sup>from loaded microsomes, whereas CHEMICAL__BPA exhibited little or no activity at these targets.
28143888	Regardless, both compounds disrupted the function of intact myotubes.
28143888	CHEMICAL__TBBPA diminished and eventually abrogated Ca<sup>2+</sup>transients, altered intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>equilibrium, and caused<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>depolarization.
28143888	For some cells, CHEMICAL__BPA caused rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>transient loss without marked changes in cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>levels, likely owing to altered cellular excitability as a result of CHEMICAL__BPA-induced<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>hyperpolarization.
28143888	CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__TBBPA both interfere with skeletal muscle function through divergent mechanisms that impair excitation-contraction coupling and may be exemplary of their adverse outcomes in other muscle types.
28145852	CHEMICAL_C087963_Safranal prevents CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in an in vitro model of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease through regulating GENE_9817_Keap1/GENE_4780_Nrf2 signaling pathway.
28145852	UNASSIGNED: CHEMICAL_C087963_Safranal, a major constituent of saffron, possesses antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties showing considerable neuroprotective effects.
28145852	However, whether CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal shows therapeutic effect on DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) remains unknown.
28145852	In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential effect of CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal on DISEASE_D010300_PD using an in vitro model of DISEASE_D010300_PD induced by CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone.
28145852	We found that CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal significantly inhibited CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner.
28145852	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal also markedly suppressed the reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell apoptosis induced by CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone.
28145852	Further investigation showed that CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal inhibited the expression of GENE_9817_kelch_like_ECH_associated_protein_1 (GENE_9817_Keap1) and promoted the nuclear translocation of GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2 (GENE_4780_Nrf2) in CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons.
28145852	Meanwhile, the downstream antioxidant enzyme genes of GENE_4780_Nrf2 including CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione S transferase (GENE_373156_GST), GENE_2729_glutamate_cysteine_ligase_catalytic_subunit (GENE_2729_GCLc), GENE_1728_NADPH_quinone_oxidoreductase_1 (GENE_1728_NQO1) and GENE_3162_heme_oxygenase1 (HO-1) were also induced by CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal in CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons.
28145852	However, the knockdown of GENE_4780_Nrf2 significantly abrogated the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal on CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28145852	Taken together, our study suggests that CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal protects against CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity associated with GENE_4780_Nrf2 signaling pathway implying that CHEMICAL_C087963_safranal may serve as a potent and promising therapeutic drug for the treatment of DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28153594	Dose-dependent effect of CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A on insulin signaling molecules in cardiac muscle of adult male SPECIES_10116_rat.
28153594	Environmental contaminant, CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a CHEMICAL__xenoestrogen, an essential component used for the production of two classes of polymers such as CHEMICAL_61433_polycarbonate and CHEMICAL_30721_epoxy resin which disrupts the normal endocrine function.
28153594	CHEMICAL__BPA has intense effects on SPECIES_10090_mice endocrine pancreas, an essential tissue involved in CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose metabolism.
28153594	It disrupts pancreatic b-cell insulin content, induces DISEASE_D006946_hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in male SPECIES_10116_rats.
28153594	Cardiac muscle is an insulin responsive organ and insulin has direct effects on CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transport.
28153594	The present study was designed to assess the effect of CHEMICAL__BPA on insulin signaling molecules in the cardiac muscle of adult male Wistar SPECIES_10116_rat.
28153594	Adult male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats (200-250  g) were selected and divided into following groups: Group 1: Control (vehicle treated), Group 2: SPECIES_10116_Rats treated with 10  mg CHEMICAL__BPA/kg b.wt./day for 30 days orally, Group 3: SPECIES_10116_Rats treated with 100  mg CHEMICAL__BPA/kg b.wt./day for 30 days orally, Group 4: SPECIES_10116_Rats treated with 400  mg CHEMICAL__BPA/kg b.wt./day for 30 days orally.
28153594	IR (GENE_10116)_insulin_receptor) and pIR(Tyr1162) proteins were significantly decreased in the high dose group (400  mg).
28153594	There was no change in GENE_10116)_IRS1 (GENE_10116)_insulin_receptor_substrate_1) and GENE_10116)_Akt proteins.
28153594	Whereas, a decrease in pIRS1(Tyr632) (100  mg and 400  mg), pAkt (Ser473) (400  mg) and GENE_10116)_GLUT4 (CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporter 4) (cytosolic and plasma membrane) proteins was observed which may affect the cardiovascular function.
28153594	It is concluded that CHEMICAL__BPA exposure has adverse effect on cardiac insulin signal transduction which may affect its function.
28153600	Role of oxidative stress and DNA hydroxymethylation in the DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity of fine particulate matter.
28153600	Epidemiological studies have implicated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a risk factor for DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_diseases and DISEASE_D002658_neurodevelopmental_disorders.
28153600	However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the influences of different components remain largely elusive.
28153600	Here, we extended our previous work to investigate the role of oxidative stress and DNA hydroxymethylation in neuronal pathology of PM2.5.
28153600	We found PM2.5 and its extracts (water-soluble extracts, organic extracts and CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon core component) differentially caused cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis and the cell proliferation inhibition in neuronal cells.
28153600	These effects were mechanistically related to each other and oxidative stress, suggesting PM2.5 and toxic compounds adsorbed on the particles may cause different types of DISEASE_D001927_brain_damages.
28153600	In addition, PM2.5 and its organic extracts increased global DNA hydroxymethylation and gene-specific DNA hydroxymethylation of neuronal genes, and subsequently interfered with their mRNA expression.
28153600	The DISEASE_D009410_impairments_in_neuronal_progression characterized with decreased length of neurite and reduced mRNA expression of neuronal markers and synaptic markers.
28153600	The blocking effects of antioxidants demonstrated the involvement of oxidative stress-mediated hydroxymethylation abnormalities in PM2.5-induced defects in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation.
28153600	Our results first revealed the role of oxidative stress-mediated abnormal DNA hydroxymethylation in neuronal impairments of PM2.5, and thoroughly evaluated the neurocytotoxicity of different components.
28154176	A GENE_10090)_KRAS GTPase PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|K|104|Q_K104Q Mutant Retains Downstream Signaling by Offsetting Defects in Regulation.
28154176	The GENE_10090)_KRAS GTPase plays a critical role in the control of cellular growth.
28154176	The activity of GENE_10090)_KRAS is regulated by CHEMICAL_61292_guanine_nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and also post-translational modification.
28154176	CHEMICAL_25094_Lysine 104 in GENE_10090)_KRAS can be modified by ubiquitylation and acetylation, but the role of this residue in intrinsic GENE_10090)_KRAS function has not been well characterized.
28154176	We find that CHEMICAL_25094_lysine 104 is important for GENE_10090)_GEF recognition, because mutations at this position impaired GENE_10090)_GEF-mediated CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide exchange.
28154176	Because the GENE_10090)_KRAS PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|K|104|Q_K104Q mutant has recently been employed as an acetylation mimetic, we conducted a series of studies to evaluate its in vitro and cell-based properties.
28154176	Herein, we found that GENE_10090)_KRAS PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|K|104|Q_K104Q exhibited defects in both GENE_10090)_GEF-mediated exchange and GAP-mediated CHEMICAL_D006160_GTP hydrolysis, consistent with NMR-detected structural perturbations in localized regions of GENE_10090)_KRAS important for recognition of these regulatory proteins.
28154176	Despite the partial defect in both GENE_10090)_GEF and GAP regulation, GENE_10090)_KRAS PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|K|104|Q_K104Q did not alter steady-state GTP-bound levels or the ability of the oncogenic GENE_10090)_KRAS PROTEINMUTATION_121913529_G12V mutant to cause morphologic transformation of NIH 3T3 SPECIES_10090_mouse fibroblasts and of WT GENE_10090)_KRAS to rescue the growth defect of SPECIES_10090_mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in all Ras genes.
28154176	We conclude that the GENE_10090)_KRAS PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|K|104|Q_K104Q mutant retains both WT and mutant GENE_10090)_KRAS function, probably due to offsetting defects in recognition of factors that up-regulate (GENE_10090)_GEF) and down-regulate (GAP) RAS activity.
28159594	Protective effect of CHEMICAL_C018381_carnosic_acid against CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in DISEASE_D012164_RPE cells.
28159594	CHEMICAL_D020106_Acrylamide is a substance that can be DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxic in SPECIES_9606_humans and experimental animals.
28159594	It is formed at different rates in starchy foods cooked at temperatures above 120    C as a result of interaction between CHEMICAL_D009005_monosaccharides and the CHEMICAL__amino_acid_asparagine.
28159594	CHEMICAL_C018381_Carnosic_acid accounts for over 90% of the antioxidant properties of SPECIES_39367_rosemary extract and is a powerful inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in microsomal and liposomal systems.
28159594	CHEMICAL_C018381_Carnosic_acid has been shown to protect against oxidative and inflammatory effects.
28159594	In order to investigate the protective properties of CHEMICAL_C018381_carnosic_acid against CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D012164_retinal_pigment_epithelium (DISEASE_D012164_RPE) cells, SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19  cells were pre-treated with 10   M CHEMICAL_C018381_carnosic_acid for 24  h followed by treatment with CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide (0.7 or 1  mM) for 24  h. SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19  cells pre-treated with 10   M CHEMICAL_C018381_carnosic_acid showed significantly increased cell viability and decreased cell death rate when compared to SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19  cells treated with CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide alone.
28159594	Activities of SOD and catalase and the level of CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH and expression of GENE_4780_NRF2 and a number of anti-oxidant genes were significantly decreased in SPECIES_9606_ARPE_19  cells, while there were significant increases in ROS and CHEMICAL_566274_MDA; pre-treatment with CHEMICAL_C018381_carnosic_acid significantly counteracted these changes.
28159594	Our results suggest that CHEMICAL_C018381_carnosic_acid protected DISEASE_D012164_RPE cells from CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28158927	Analysis of the roles of dietary protein and CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium in CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride-induced changes in T-lymphocyte subsets in SPECIES_10116_rat.
28158927	The roles of dietary protein (Pr) and CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium (CHEMICAL_D002118_Ca) levels on the changes in T-lymphocyte subsets induced by excessive CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride (F) intake were assessed using SPECIES_10116_rats that were malnourished for 120 days as a model.
28158927	The DISEASE_D006223_CD(4+) and DISEASE_D006223_CD(8+) T-lymphocytes in the spleen tissue were determined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assay.
28158927	The percentages of CHEMICAL__CD_3_ , CHEMICAL__CD_4_ , and DISEASE_D006223_CD(8+) T-lymphocytes were reduced in the spleen of SPECIES_10116_rats exposed to excessive F, and DISEASE_D044342_malnutrition aggravated these changes in the T-lymphocytes.
28158927	In addition, the mRNA expression levels of GENE_10116)_IL_1b, GENE_10116)_IL_2, GENE_10116)_IL_6, GENE_10116)_TNF_a, and IFN-y in the spleen were downregulated significantly.
28158927	We also reported herein the increased apoptosis ratio following GENE_10116)_caspase_9 and GENE_10116)_caspase_3 upregulation in the spleen of SPECIES_10116_rats exposed to excessive amount of F. Light and transmisison electron microscopy revealed the irregularly arranged lymphocytes, few lymph nodules and the apoptotic characteristic of lymphocytes, which are caused by the increased expression of caspase.
28158927	In addition, Pr and CHEMICAL_D002118_Ca supplementation reversed the morphologic and T-lymphocytic changes in spleen under DISEASE_D044342_malnutrition.
28158927	Taken together, our results revealed an endogenous caspase-mediated mechanism of regulating the apoptosis of the T-lymphocyte subsets, as well as the immune-related cytokine secretion, which reduces the immune function in F-induced SPECIES_10116_rats.

28159858	Transcriptomic alterations in the brain of SPECIES_8479_painted_turtles (SPECIES_8479_Chrysemys_picta) developmentally exposed to CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A or CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinyl_estradiol.
28159858	Developmental exposure of turtles and other reptiles to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinyl_estradiol (EE), can stimulate partial to full gonadal sex-reversal in males.
28159858	We have also recently shown that in ovo exposure to either EDC can induce similar sex-dependent behavioral changes typified by improved spatial learning and memory or possibly feminized brain responses.
28159858	Observed behavioral changes are presumed to be due to CHEMICAL__BPA- and EE-induced brain transcriptomic alterations during development.
28159858	To test this hypothesis, we treated SPECIES_8479_painted_turtles (SPECIES_8479_Chrysemys_picta) at developmental stage 17, incubated at 26  C (male-inducing temperature), with 1) CHEMICAL__BPA (1 ng/  l), 2) EE (4 ng/  l), or 3) vehicle CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol (control group).
28159858	Ten months after hatching and completion of the behavioral tests, juvenile turtles were euthanized, brains were collected and frozen in liquid CHEMICAL_D009584_nitrogen, and RNA was isolated for RNA-Seq analysis.
28159858	Turtles exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA clustered separately from EE-exposed and control individuals.
28159858	More transcripts and gene pathways were altered in CHEMICAL__BPA vs. EE individuals.
28159858	The one transcript upregulated in both CHEMICAL__BPA- and EE-exposed individuals was the mitochondrial-associated gene, GENE_8479)_ND5, which is involved in oxidative phosphorylation.
28159858	Early exposure of turtles to CHEMICAL__BPA increases transcripts linked with ribosomal and mitochondrial functions, especially bioenergetics, which has been previously linked with improved cognitive performance.
28159858	In summary, even though both CHEMICAL__BPA and EE resulted in similar behavioral alterations, they diverge in the pattern of neural transcript alterations with early CHEMICAL__BPA significantly upregulating several genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial activity, and ribosomal function, which could enhance cognitive performance.
28161095	Environmental obesogen CHEMICAL_C011559_tributyltin_chloride leads to DISEASE_D007027_abnormal_hypothalamic_pituitary_gonadal_axis function by disruption in kisspeptin/leptin signaling in female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28161095	CHEMICAL_C011559_Tributyltin_chloride (CHEMICAL_27086_TBT) is a xenobiotic used as a biocide in antifouling paints that has been demonstrated to induce endocrine-disrupting effects, such as DISEASE_D009765_obesity and DISEASE_D018376_reproductive_abnormalities.
28161095	An integrative metabolic control in the DISEASE_D006059_hypothalamus_pituitary_gonadal_HPG_axis was exerted by leptin.
28161095	However, studies that have investigated the obesogenic CHEMICAL_27086_TBT effects on the DISEASE_D006059_HPG_axis are especially rare.
28161095	We investigated whether DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disorders as a result of CHEMICAL_27086_TBT are correlated with DISEASE_D006058_abnormal_hypothalamus_pituitary_gonadal_HPG_axis function, as well as kisspeptin (Kiss) action.
28161095	Female SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were administered vehicle and CHEMICAL_27086_TBT (100ng/kg/day) for 15days via gavage.
28161095	We analyzed their effects on the tin serum and ovary accumulation (as biomarker of CHEMICAL_27086_TBT exposure), estrous cyclicity, surge LH levels, GnRH expression, Kiss action, fertility, CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels, DISEASE_D010049_ovarian_apoptosis, DISEASE_D007249_uterine_inflammation, DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis, CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen negative feedback, body DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain, insulin, leptin, GENE_10116)_adiponectin levels, as well as the CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance (GTT) and insulin sensitivity tests (IST).
28161095	CHEMICAL_27086_TBT led to increased serum and ovary tin levels, irregular estrous cyclicity, and decreased surge LH levels, GnRH expression and Kiss responsiveness.
28161095	A strong negative correlation between the serum and ovary tin levels with lower Kiss responsiveness and GnRH mRNA expression was observed in CHEMICAL_27086_TBT SPECIES_10116_rats.
28161095	An increase in the CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels, ovarian and uterine DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis, DISEASE_D010049_ovarian_apoptosis, and DISEASE_D007249_uterine_inflammation and a decrease in fertility and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen negative feedback were demonstrated in the CHEMICAL_27086_TBT SPECIES_10116_rats.
28161095	We also identified an increase in the body DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain and abnormal GTT and IST tests, which were associated with DISEASE_D006946_hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and DISEASE_C567258_hypoadiponectinemia, in the CHEMICAL_27086_TBT SPECIES_10116_rats.
28161095	CHEMICAL_27086_TBT disrupted proper functioning of the DISEASE_D006059_HPG_axis as a result of abnormal Kiss action.
28161095	The DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_dysfunctions co-occur with the DISEASE_D006058_HPG_axis_abnormalities.
28161095	Hyperleptinemia as a result of DISEASE_D009765_obesity induced by CHEMICAL_27086_TBT may be associated with abnormal HPG function.
28161095	A strong negative correlation between the hyperleptinemia and lower Kiss responsiveness was observed in the CHEMICAL_27086_TBT SPECIES_10116_rats.
28161095	These findings provide evidence that CHEMICAL_27086_TBT leads to toxic effects direct on the DISEASE_D006059_HPG_axis and/or indirectly by abnormal metabolic regulation of the DISEASE_D006059_HPG_axis.
28161410	CHEMICAL_C008493_Methylseleninic_acid and CHEMICAL_D018038_sodium_selenite induce severe ER stress and subsequent apoptosis through UPR activation in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells.
28161410	CHEMICAL_D012643_Selenium compounds such as CHEMICAL_C008493_methylseleninic_acid (CHEMICAL__MSA) and CHEMICAL_D018038_sodium_selenite (DISEASE_C562576_SS) have been widely evaluated as potential anti-DISEASE_D009369_cancer agents in the clinical setting.
28161410	DISEASE_D054685_Primary_effusion_lymphoma (DISEASE_D054685_PEL) is a non-Hodgkin's DISEASE_D016393_B_cell_lymphoma, associated with immunosuppressed individuals, such as post-transplant or DISEASE_D000163_AIDS SPECIES_9606_patients.
28161410	SPECIES_37296_Kaposi_s_sarcoma_associated_herpesvirus_KSHV) is the causative agent of DISEASE_D054685_PEL and DISEASE_D012514_Kaposi_s_sarcoma.
28161410	Here, we found that CHEMICAL__MSA and DISEASE_C562576_SS markedly inhibited the growth of DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells compared with SPECIES_37296_KSHV-uninfected B cells.
28161410	CHEMICAL__MSA and DISEASE_C562576_SS caused ER stress, inducing the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells that resulted in pro-apoptotic UPR, and finally apoptosis.
28161410	The expression of UPR-related molecules (GRP78 and GADD34) and pro-apoptotic UPR molecules (CHOP, Bim, or SPECIES_9696_Puma) were augmented in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells treated with CHEMICAL__MSA or DISEASE_C562576_SS.
28161410	In addition, these compounds induced the activation of GENE_837_caspase_4, an ER stress specific caspase, as well as GENE_836;840;842_caspase_3_7_and_9 in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells.
28161410	We confirmed that CHEMICAL_D019284_thapsigargin which is an inducer of ER stress, dramatically decreased the viability of DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells, compared with SPECIES_37296_KSHV-uninfected Ramos cells.
28161410	We also investigated whether CHEMICAL__MSA or DISEASE_C562576_SS caused oxidization of cellular proteins in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells.
28161410	CHEMICAL__MSA and DISEASE_C562576_SS increased the levels of oxidative proteins in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells, and the anti-oxidant agent (CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine) restored cell viability and suppressed GENE_840_caspase_7 activation in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells treated with CHEMICAL__MSA or DISEASE_C562576_SS.
28161410	Finally, we confirmed that CHEMICAL__MSA and DISEASE_C562576_SS induced neither lytic replication nor viral production in DISEASE_D054685_PEL cells.
28161410	Taken together, CHEMICAL__MSA and DISEASE_C562576_SS could serve as lead compounds for the development of novel and effective drugs against DISEASE_D054685_PEL without the risk of de novo SPECIES_37296_KSHV production.
28161596	Polygoni Multiflori Radix derived CHEMICAL_D000880_anthraquinones alter CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid disposition in sandwich-cultured SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocytes.
28161596	Hepatic adverse reaction associated with Polygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) has been frequently reported in recent years.
28161596	Highly-enriched CHEMICAL_D000880_anthraquinones (CHEMICAL__AQs) in PMR, such as CHEMICAL_D004642_emodin, CHEMICAL_C027113_chrysophanol and physcion, have been found to be hepatotoxic.
28161596	In the present study, sandwich-cultured SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocytes (SCRHs) were employed to investigate the effect of individual and combined CHEMICAL__AQs on the disposition of endogenous CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids (CHEMICAL_32590_BAs) and exogenous probe substrates including CHEMICAL_D003903_deuterium-labeled CHEMICAL_D013656_taurocholate (d5-CHEMICAL_30956_TCA), CHEMICAL_D005999_glycochenodeoxycholic_acid (CHEMICAL__d4_GCDCA) and 5 (and 6)-CHEMICAL__carboxy_2_7_dichlorofluorescein (CDF).
28161596	CHEMICAL_D004642_Emodin and CHEMICAL_C027113_chrysophanol significantly inhibited CHEMICAL_3098_bile_salt export pump and GENE_10116)_multidrug_resistance_associated_protein_2 (GENE_10116)_Mrp2), respectively, as evidenced by decreased biliary excretion index (BEI) of d5-CHEMICAL_30956_TCA and CDF.
28161596	Moreover, basolateral efflux transporters were inhibited by all individual and combined CHEMICAL__AQs.
28161596	As a result, cellular accumulation of total and specific endogenous CHEMICAL_32590_BAs were significantly elevated by individual CHEMICAL__AQs, alone or combined.
28161596	In addition, down-regulation of Mrps in both gene and protein levels by CHEMICAL__AQs served as another critical contributing factor for BA accumulation in SCRHs.
28161596	To be noted, subsequent adaptive gene regulation, including reduced GENE_10116)_Ntcp expression, upregulated GENE_10116)_Bsep levels, and downregulated GENE_10116)_Cyp8b1, alleviated, to a certain extent, but not prevented from toxic BA accumulation.
28161596	In summary, all three CHEMICAL__AQs of interest are likely to alter BA disposition through direct inhibition of BA transporters as well as regulated expression of BA transporters and enzymes.
28163111	A compromised liver alters polychlorinated CHEMICAL_C010574_biphenyl-mediated DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28163111	Exposure to environmental toxicants namely CHEMICAL_D011078_polychlorinated_biphenyls (CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs) is correlated with DISEASE_D030342_multiple_health_disorders including liver and DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases.
28163111	The liver is important for both xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.
28163111	However, the responses of an injured liver to subsequent environmental insults has not been investigated.
28163111	The current study aims to evaluate the role of a compromised liver in GENE_10090)_PCB-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and define the implications on overall body homeostasis.
28163111	SPECIES_9606_Male SPECIES_10090_C57Bl_6 SPECIES_10090_mice were fed either an CHEMICAL_D000596_amino_acid DISEASE_D007174_control_diet (DISEASE_D007174_CD) or a DISEASE_D002796_methionine_choline_deficient_diet (DISEASE_D002796_MCD) during the 12-week study.
28163111	SPECIES_10090_Mice were subsequently exposed to either CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 (4.9mg/kg) or the GENE_10090)_PCB mixture, CHEMICAL__Arcolor1260 (20mg/kg) and analyzed for inflammatory, calorimetry and metabolic parameters.
28163111	Consistent with the literature, DISEASE_D002796_MCD diet-fed SPECIES_10090_mice demonstrated DISEASE_D005234_steatosis, indicative of a compromised liver.
28163111	SPECIES_10090_Mice fed the DISEASE_D002796_MCD-diet and subsequently exposed to CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 showed observable wasting syndrome leading to mortality.
28163111	CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 and CHEMICAL_C026987_Aroclor1260 exposure worsened hepatic DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis exhibited by the DISEASE_D002796_MCD groups.
28163111	Interestingly, CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 but not CHEMICAL_C026987_Aroclor1260 induced DISEASE_D005234_steatosis and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in DISEASE_D007174_CD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28163111	SPECIES_10090_Mice with DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury and subsequently exposed to CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs also manifested metabolic disturbances due to alterations in hepatic gene expression.
28163111	Furthermore, GENE_10090)_PCB exposure in DISEASE_D002796_MCD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice led to extra-hepatic DISEASE_D064420_toxicity such as upregulated circulating inflammatory biomarkers, implicating endothelial cell dysfunction.
28163111	Taken together, these results indicate that environmental pollution can exacerbate DISEASE_D064420_toxicity caused by diet-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury which may be partially due to dysfunctional energy homeostasis.
28163111	This is relevant to GENE_5091_PCB-exposed SPECIES_9606_human cohorts who suffer from CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol or diet-induced DISEASE_D008107_fatty_liver_diseases.
28163245	Anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen CHEMICAL_C014290_2_hydroxyflutamide modulates cadherin, catenin and GENE_367_androgen_receptor phosphorylation in CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-sensitive LNCaP and CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-independent DISEASE_D011471_PC3_prostate_cancer cell lines acting via GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt and MAPK/GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 pathways.
28163245	This study aimed to investigate rapid effect of anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen CHEMICAL_C014290_2_hydroxyflutamide (HF) on cadherin/catenin complex and GENE_367_androgen_receptor (GENE_367_AR) phosphorylation in DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer cell lines.
28163245	In addition, a role of GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt and MAPK/GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 pathways in mediating these effects was explored.
28163245	We have demonstrated that in CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells HF induced rapid increase of GENE_999_E_cadherin phosphorylation at Ser 838/840 (p<0.05) in MAPK/GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylation of GENE_1499_b_catenin at Tyr 654 was unchanged.
28163245	Concomitantly, the reduction of the level of GENE_367_AR phosphorylated at Ser210/213 was found (p<0.01).
28163245	In CHEMICAL_50113_androgen-independent GENE_5122_PC3 cells HF decreased Tyr 860 N-cadherin and Tyr 645 GENE_1499_b_catenin phosphorylation (p<0.01), acting via both MAPK/GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 and GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt pathways.
28163245	Further, we evidenced that MAPK/GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 and GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt pathways were differentially influenced by HF in LNCaP and GENE_5122_PC3 cells.
28163245	In LNCaP cells, both GENE_207_Akt (p<0.01) and GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 (p<0.001) phosphorylation were negatively regulated and this effect was mediated by GENE_5894_Raf_1 (p<0.05).
28163245	In contrast, in GENE_5122_PC3 cells HF stimulated GENE_207_Akt (p<0.001) and GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 (p<0.001) activation, but had no effect on the crosstalk between GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt and GENE_5609_MEK/GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 pathways at the GENE_5894_Raf_1 kinase level.
28163245	Our findings expand the role of anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen into non-genomic signaling, creating a link between anti-CHEMICAL_50113_androgen action and phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins in DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer cells.
28163246	CHEMICAL_C005445_Triphenyl_phosphate enhances adipogenic differentiation, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake and lipolysis via endocrine and noradrenergic mechanisms.
28163246	The use of CHEMICAL_C005445_triphenyl_phosphate (CHEMICAL__TPhP) as a flame retardant or plasticizer has increased during the last decade, resulting in widespread SPECIES_9606_human exposure without commensurate DISEASE_D064420_toxicity assessment.
28163246	The main objectives of this study were to assess the in vitro effect of CHEMICAL__TPhP and its metabolite CHEMICAL__diphenyl_phosphate (CHEMICAL__DPhP) on the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, as well as CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake and lipolysis in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
28163246	CHEMICAL__TPhP increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and subsequent adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, coinciding with increased transcription in the GENE_10090)_CEBP and GENE_10090)_PPARG pathway.
28163246	Treatment of mature adipocytes with CHEMICAL__TPhP increased the basal- and insulin stimulated- uptake of the CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose analog CHEMICAL_C098340_2_N_7_nitrobenz_2_oxa1_3_diazol_4_yl_amino_2_deoxy_d_glucose (2-NBDG).
28163246	This effect was ablated by inhibition of GENE_10090)_PI3K, a member of the insulin signaling pathway.
28163246	CHEMICAL__DPhP had no significant effect on cell proliferation and, compared to CHEMICAL__TPhP, a weaker effect on adipogenic differentiation and on 2-NBDG uptake.
28163246	Both CHEMICAL__TPhP and CHEMICAL__DPhT significantly enhanced the CHEMICAL_D007545_isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, most likely by increasing the expression of lipolytic genes during and after differentiation.
28163246	This study suggests that CHEMICAL__TPhP increases adipogenic differentiation, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake, and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells through endocrine and noradrenergic mechanisms.
28167099	CHEMICAL_C076996_27_Hydroxycholesterol regulates CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol synthesis and transport in C6 DISEASE_D005910_glioma cells.
28167099	UNASSIGNED: The CHEMICAL__oxysterol_27_Hydroxycholesterol (CHEMICAL__27_OHC) is a major CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol metabolite that can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) from peripheral circulation to the brain.
28167099	Currently, the role of CHEMICAL__27_OHC on CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes and the underlying mechanisms are not defined.
28167099	Since all brain CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol is essentially synthesized in brain itself and astrocytes as net producers of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol are essential for normal brain function, here we investigated the effects of CHEMICAL__27_OHC on CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol synthesis and transport in C6 DISEASE_D005910_glioma cells.
28167099	C6 cells were treated with 5, 10 and 20 M CHEMICAL__27_OHC for 24h and the cell viability and apoptosis, the CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol levels and metabolism-related mediators, genes and proteins were subsequently assessed using cell-counting kit (CCK)-8, Amplex red, ELISA, real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.
28167099	We found that CHEMICAL__27_OHC decreased CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol levels by down-regulating the expression of CHEMICAL_15889_sterol-regulated element binding protein-1 (GENE_6720_SREBP_1a), CHEMICAL_C008047_3_hydroxy_3_methylglutaryl_CoA reductase (GENE_3156_HMG_CR) and GENE_3949_low_density_lipoprotein_receptor (GENE_3949_LDLR) and promoted CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol transport by up-regulating the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-y (GENE_5465_PPAR-y), GENE_10062_liver_X_receptor_a (GENE_10062_LXR_a), CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 (ABCA1) and GENE_348_apolipoprotein_E (GENE_348_ApoE)genes.
28167099	Our results suggested that CHEMICAL__27_OHC may represent a sensitive modulator of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol metabolism disorder by suppressing CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol synthesis and stimulating CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol transport in astrocytes.
28168795	CHEMICAL_C025256_Nonylphenol increases DISEASE_D009369_tumor formation and growth by suppressing gender-independent lymphocyte proliferation and macrophage activation.
28168795	CHEMICAL_C025256_Nonylphenol (NP) is a well-known endocrine disruptor that influences DISEASE_D012734_sexual_and_reproductive_development.
28168795	Here, we investigated whether NP affects immune responses that are associated with DISEASE_D009369_tumor initiation and progression.
28168795	When spleen cells were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A in the presence of 10(-4) M NP, the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes was reduced compared with that in controls, in a gender-independent fashion.
28168795	While 10(-4) M NP also decreased the production of CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO) in LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), no changes in NO production were detected following treatment with 10(-5) M NP.
28168795	LPS-stimulated expression of GENE_10090)_iNOS, GENE_10090)_COX2, GENE_10090)_IL_6 and GENE_10090)_TNF_a in BMDMs was reduced after 6 or 18 hours of incubation with 10(-5) M NP.
28168795	Furthermore, when SPECIES_10090_mice were pre-exposed to NP for 7 days prior to the injection of SPECIES_10090_B16F10 DISEASE_D008545_melanoma cells, the rates of DISEASE_D009369_tumor nodule formation and relative DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth were higher than those in the control group.
28168795	In vivo immunosuppressive effect was also clarified by the inhibition of proliferation in B/T lymphocyte and cytokine production in peritoneal macrophages from the SPECIES_10090_mice pretreated with NP for 7 days.
28168795	Taken together, these data demonstrate that NP could affect the immune responses of lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to the suppression of their DISEASE_D009369_tumor-preventing ability.
28168795	This suggests that individuals at high risk for DISEASE_D009369_tumor development should avoid frequent exposure to NP and other endocrine disruptors.
28174063	Use of early phenotypic in vivo markers to assess SPECIES_9606_human relevance of an unusual SPECIES_10116_rodent non-genotoxic carcinogen in vitro.
28174063	DISEASE_D004408_Foci_of_altered_hepatocytes (DISEASE_D004408_FAH) are considered putative, pre-neoplastic lesions that can occur spontaneously in aging rodents, but can also be induced by chemicals or drugs.
28174063	Progression of DISEASE_D006528_FAH_to_hepatocellular_neoplasms has been reported repeatedly but increases in foci in rodents do not necessarily lead to DISEASE_D009369_tumors in carcinogenicity studies and the relevance for SPECIES_9606_humans often remains unclear.
28174063	Here we present the case of CHEMICAL_C554954_RG3487, a molecule which induced DISEASE_D004408_FAH and, later on, DISEASE_D009369_tumors in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28174063	Because the molecule was negative in genotoxicity assays it was classified as a non-genotoxic carcinogen.
28174063	In order to assess the potential for DISEASE_D008113_liver_tumor formation in SPECIES_9606_humans, we analyzed treatment-induced changes in vivo to establish a possible mode of action (MoA).
28174063	In vivo and in vitro gene expression analysis revealed that nuclear receptor signaling was unlikely to be the relevant MoA and no other known mechanism could be established.
28174063	We therefore took an approach comparing phenotypic markers, including mRNA changes, proliferation and glycogen accumulation, in vitro using cells of different species to assess the SPECIES_9606_human relevance of this finding.
28174063	Since the alterations observed in SPECIES_10116_rats were not seen in the liver of SPECIES_10090_mice or SPECIES_9615_dogs in vivo, we could validate the relevance of the cell models chosen by use of hepatocytes from these species in vitro.
28174063	This ultimately allowed for a cross-species comparison, which suggested that the formation of DISEASE_D004408_FAH and DISEASE_D008113_liver_tumors was SPECIES_10116_rat specific and unlikely to translate to SPECIES_9606_human.
28174063	Our work showed that phenotypic species comparison in vitro is a useful approach for assessment of the SPECIES_9606_human relevance of pre-clinical findings where no known mechanism can be established.
28181416	Preventive effects of Ophiocordyceps sinensis mycelium on the liver DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis induced by CHEMICAL_D013853_thioacetamide.
28181416	CHEMICAL_D013853_Thioacetamide (CHEMICAL_32497_TAA), usually used as a fungicide to control the decay of citrus products, itself is not toxic to the liver, but its intermediates are able to increase oxidative stress in livers and further cause DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28181416	Ophiocordyceps sinensis mycelium (OSM) which contains 10% polysaccharides and 0.25% CHEMICAL_D000241_adenosine decreased (P < 0.05) the lipid accumulation and increased (P   <   0.05) antioxidative capacity in livers of CHEMICAL_D013853_thioacetamide (CHEMICAL_32497_TAA) injected SPECIES_10116_rats.
28181416	Meanwhile, the increased (P < 0.05) liver sizes, serum CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine transaminase (AST) and CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate transaminase (ALT) values in CHEMICAL_D013853_thioacetamide (CHEMICAL_32497_TAA)-injected SPECIES_10116_rats were ameliorated (P   <   0.05) by OSM supplementation.
28181416	Moreover, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as the GENE_10116)_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_10116)_TNF_a) and GENE_10116)_interleukin_1b (GENE_10116)_IL_1b), were also reduced (P   <   0.05).
28181416	The DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis phenomena in pathological (Masson's trichrome and H_E stainings) and immunohistochemical [a-smooth actin (aSMA) and GENE_10116)_CD86/ED1] observations in CHEMICAL_32497_TAA-treated SPECIES_10116_rats were reduced (P < 0.05) by OSM cotreatment.
28181416	The protective effect of OSM against CHEMICAL_32497_TAA-induced DISEASE_D008107_liver_inflammation/DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis may be via downregulations (P   <   0.05) of TGF-b pathways and NFkB which further influenced (P   <   0.05) the expressions of fibrotic and inflammatory genes (i. e., aSMA, Col1a, GENE_10116)_COX2).
28181416	Therefore, OSM shows preventive effects on the development of CHEMICAL_32497_TAA-induced DISEASE_D008103_hepatic_fibrosis.
28181380	CHEMICAL_C017875_Fisetin-induced apoptosis of human DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer SCC-4 cells through reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species production, endoplasmic reticulum stress, caspase-, and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways.
28181380	DISEASE_D009369_Oral_cancer is one of the DISEASE_D009369_cancer_related_diseases in human populations and its incidence rates are rising worldwide.
28181380	CHEMICAL_C017875_Fisetin, a CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid from natural products, has been shown to exhibit anticancer activities in many human DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell lines but the molecular mechanism of CHEMICAL_C017875_fisetin-induced apoptosis in human DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer cells is still unclear; thus, in this study, we investigated CHEMICAL_C017875_fisetin-induced cell death and associated signal pathways on human DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer SCC-4 cells in vitro.
28181380	We examined cell morphological changes, total viable cells, and cell cycle distribution by phase contrast microscopy and flow cytometry assays.
28181380	Reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS), CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ , mitochondria membrane potential (    m ), and caspase-8, -9, and -3 activities were also measured by flow cytometer.
28181380	Results indicate that CHEMICAL_C017875_fisetin induced cell death through the cell morphological changes, caused G2/M phase arrest, induction of apoptosis, promoted ROS and CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ production, and decreased the level of     m and increased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities in SCC-4 cells.
28181380	DAPI staining and DNA gel electrophoresis were also used to confirm CHEMICAL_C017875_fisetin-induced cell apoptosis in SCC-4 cells.
28181380	Western blotting also found out that CHEMICAL_C017875_Fisetin increased the proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid and decreased the antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2.
28181380	Furthermore, results also showed that CHEMICAL_C017875_Fisetin increased the cytochrome c, AIF, and Endo G release from mitochondria in SCC-4 cells.
28181380	We also used ATF-6a, ATF-6b, GADD153, and GRP78 which indicated that CHEMICAL_C017875_fisetin induced cell death through ER stress.
28181380	Based on those observations, we suggest that CHEMICAL_C017875_fisetin induced cell apoptosis through ER stress, mitochondria-, and caspase-dependent pathways.
28181396	The CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1 -CHEMICAL_C056933_fumonisin_B1 DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in BRL-3A hepatocytes is associated to induction of cytochrome P450 activity and CHEMICAL_D016718_arachidonic_acid metabolism.
28181396	Human oral exposure to CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1 (CHEMICAL__AFB1 ) and CHEMICAL_C056933_fumonisin_B1 (CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 ) is associated with DISEASE_D006528_increased_hepatocellular_carcinoma.
28181396	Although evidence suggested interactive CHEMICAL__AFB1 -CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 hepatotoxicity, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unidentified.
28181396	This work was aimed at evaluating the possible CHEMICAL__AFB1 -CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 interplay to induce genetic and cell cycle toxicities in BRL-3A rat hepatocytes, reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) involvement, and the CHEMICAL__AFB1 metabolizing pathways cytochrome P450 (CYP) and CHEMICAL_D016718_arachidonic_acid (CHEMICAL_D003561_ArAc) metabolism as ROS contributors.
28181396	Flow cytometry of stained BRL-3A hepatocytes was used to study the cell cycle (CHEMICAL_D011419_propidium_iodide), ROS intracellular production (CHEMICAL_C029569_DCFH_DA, HE, CHEMICAL_C414689_DAF_2_DA), and phospholipase A activity (staining with CHEMICAL__bis_BODIPY FL C11-PC).
28181396	The CYP1A activity was assessed by the CHEMICAL_34480_7_ethoxyresorufin-CHEMICAL__O-deethylase (EROD) assay.
28181396	Despite a 48-h exposure to CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 (30   M) not being genotoxic, the CHEMICAL__AFB1 (20   M)-induced micronucleus frequency was overcome by the CHEMICAL__AFB1 -CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 mixture (MIX), presumably showing toxin interaction.
28181396	The mycotoxins blocked G1/S-phase, but only MIX caused cell death.
28181396	Overall, the oxidative stress led these alterations as the pretreatment with CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine reduced such toxic effects.
28181396	While CHEMICAL__AFB1 had a major input to the MIX pro-oxidant activity, with CYP and CHEMICAL_D003561_ArAc metabolism being ROS contributors, these pathways were not involved in the CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 -elicited weak oxidative stress.
28181396	The MIX-induced micronucleus frequency in CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine pretreated cells was greater than that caused by CHEMICAL__AFB1 without antioxidants, suggesting enhanced CHEMICAL__AFB1 direct genotoxicity probably owing to the higher CYP activity and CHEMICAL_D003561_ArAc metabolism found in MIX.
28181396	The metabolic pathways modulation by CHEMICAL__AFB1 -CHEMICAL_38221_FB1 mixtures could raise its hepatocarcinogenic properties.
28181402	CHEMICAL_D000487_Allethrin DISEASE_D064420_toxicity causes DISEASE_D008107_reproductive_dysfunction in male rats.
28181402	CHEMICAL_D011722_Pyrethroids are widely used for domestic and agricultural purposes and their use is increasing, especially in developing countries.
28181402	Uncontrolled use of these insecticides resulted in their entry into the food chain thereby causing DISEASE_D064420_toxicity to different organ systems.
28181402	CHEMICAL_D000487_Allethrin is one of the widely used CHEMICAL_D011722_pyrethroids, but its toxicological effects are underreported when compared to other CHEMICAL_D011722_pyrethroids.
28181402	Further, its effects on the male reproductive tract remain uncharacterized.
28181402	In this study, its DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on the male reproductive tract was evaluated by administering 25-150 mg/kg body weight CHEMICAL_D000487_allethrin to adult rats for 60 days.
28181402	The mRNA expression of factors that are important in spermatogenesis (Scf, c-Kit, Hsf2, Ovol1, Brdt, Kdm3A, Ybx-2, and Grth) and steroidogenesis (StAR, 3b-HSD, 17b-HSD) was significantly downregulated.
28181402	Decreased levels of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, reduced sperm count and daily sperm production was also observed due to CHEMICAL_D000487_allethrin DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28181402	However, sperm quality parameters assessed by computer-assisted sperm analyzer were not affected.
28181402	Spermatozoa obtained from CHEMICAL_D000487_allethrin-treated rats failed to undergo acrosome reaction.
28181402	Results of this study indicate that CHEMICAL_D000487_allethrin affects spermatogenesis and sperm function, thus lending further support to the growing evidence of its DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28182703	DISEASE_D007674_Nephropathy in GENE_10090)_Pparg-null SPECIES_10090_mice highlights PPARy systemic activities in metabolism and in the immune system.
28182703	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (PPARy) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor involved in many aspects of metabolism, immune response, and development.
28182703	Total-body deletion of the two GENE_10090)_Pparg alleles provoked generalized lipoatrophy along with severe DISEASE_D017827_type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes.
28182703	Herein, we explore the appearance and development of structural and functional alterations of the kidney, comparing GENE_10090)_Pparg null-SPECIES_10090_mice to their littermate controls (carrying GENE_10090)_Pparg floxed alleles).
28182703	We show that DISEASE_D007674_renal_hypertrophy and functional alterations with increased DISEASE_D006030_glucosuria and DISEASE_D000419_albuminuria are already present in 3 weeks-old GENE_10090)_Pparg null-SPECIES_10090_mice.
28182703	DISEASE_D051437_Renal_insufficiency with decreased CHEMICAL_D003404_creatinine clearance progress at 7 weeks of age, with the advance of the DISEASE_D017827_type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes.
28182703	At 52 weeks of age, these alterations are accompanied by signs of DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis and mesangial expansion.
28182703	More intriguingly, aged GENE_10090)_Pparg null-SPECIES_10090_mice concomitantly present an DISEASE_D016736_anti_phospholipid_syndrome (DISEASE_D016736_APS), characterized by the late appearance of microthrombi and a mesangioproliferative pattern of DISEASE_D007674_glomerular_injury, associated with significant plasmatic levels of anti-b2- glycoprotein1 antibodies and renal deposition of IgG, IgM, and C3.
28182703	Thus, in line with the role of PPARy in metabolic homeostasis, GENE_10090)_Pparg null-SPECIES_10090_mice first represent a potent model for studying the initiation and the development of DISEASE_D003928_diabetic_nephropathy.
28182703	Second, and in relation with the important PPARy activity in DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and in immune system, these SPECIES_10090_mice also highlight a new role for PPARy signaling in the promotion of DISEASE_D016736_APS, a syndrome whose pathogenesis is poorly known and whose current treatment is limited to prevention of DISEASE_D013927_thrombosis events.
28185818	CHEMICAL_C011164_Amentoflavone protects dopaminergic neurons in CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP-induced DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease model SPECIES_10090_mice through GENE_10090)_PI3K/GENE_10090)_Akt and ERK signaling pathways.
28185818	DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) is characterized by the progressive DISEASE_D009410_degeneration_of_dopaminergic_neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).
28185818	DISEASE_D028361_Mitochondrial_dysfunction and cell apoptosis are suggested to be actively involved in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28185818	In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of CHEMICAL_C011164_amentoflavone (AF), a naturally occurring CHEMICAL_50128_biflavonoid from Selaginella tamariscina, was examined in DISEASE_D010300_PD models both in vitro and in vivo.
28185818	On SH-SY5Y cells, AF treatment dose-dependently reduced CHEMICAL_D015655_1_methyl_4_phenylpyridinium (CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_)-induced nuclear condensation and loss of cell viability without obvious DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28185818	It inhibited the activation of GENE_10090)_caspase_3 and GENE_10090)_p21 but increased the GENE_10090)_Bcl_2/GENE_10090)_Bax ratio.
28185818	Further study disclosed that AF enhanced the phosphorylation of GENE_5293_PI3K, GENE_207_Akt and GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 down-regulated by CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ in SH-SY5Y cells, the effect of which could be blocked by CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002, the inhibitor of GENE_5293_PI3K.
28185818	Consistently, AF alleviated the behavioral deterioration in pole and traction tests and rescued the loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc and fibers in striatum in CHEMICAL__methyl_4_phenyl_1_2_3_6_tetrahydropyridine (CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP) induced SPECIES_10090_mice.
28185818	It also could enhance the activation of GENE_10090)_PI3K and GENE_10090)_Akt as well as GENE_10090)_Bcl_2/GENE_10090)_Bax ratio in SN.
28185818	Moreover, AF alleviated DISEASE_D005911_gliosis as well as the gene expression levels of GENE_10090)_IL_1b and GENE_10090)_iNOS in SN.
28185818	Collectively, these results suggested that AF protected dopaminergic neurons against CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP/CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity, which might be mediated through activation of GENE_10090)_PI3K/GENE_10090)_Akt and ERK signaling pathways in dopaminergic neurons and DISEASE_C538265_attenuation_of_neuroinflammation.
28185984	CHEMICAL_D006862_Hydrogen_sulfide in paraventricular nucleus attenuates blood pressure by regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in high salt-induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertension.
28185984	CHEMICAL_D006862_Hydrogen_sulfide (CHEMICAL_36945_H2S) is an important gaseous signaling molecule in neuro-modulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-DISEASE_D006973_hypertensive effects.
28185984	The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is a major integrative nucleus in regulating BP and SNA.
28185984	The aim of this study is to explore whether endogenous or exogenous CHEMICAL_36945_H2S changed by CHEMICAL_D019811_hydroxylamine_hydrochloride (HA) or CHEMICAL_C529376_GYY4137 infused in the PVN affects RSNA and MAP by regulating oxidative stress or the balance between pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and anti-inflammatory cytokines in high salt-induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertensive SPECIES_10116_rats.
28185984	Male Dahl SPECIES_10116_rats were fed by high-salt or normal-salt diet.
28185984	At the end of the 4th week, CHEMICAL_C529376_GYY4137, HA or vehicle was microinjected into bilateral PVN for 6 weeks.
28185984	The levels of MAP, HR, plasma CHEMICAL_D009638_norepinephrine (NE), reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS), GENE_10116)_NOX2, GENE_10116)_NOX4 and GENE_10116)_IL_1b were increased significantly in high salt-induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertensive SPECIES_10116_rats.
28185984	Higher levels of these parameters were detected in the group treated by HA, but lower levels in the CHEMICAL_C529376_GYY4137 group.
28185984	The trends of CHEMICAL_36945_H2S, CBS, GENE_10116)_IL_10 and GENE_10116)_Cu_Zn_SOD were opposite to the parameters described above.
28185984	These findings suggest that endogenous or exogenous CHEMICAL_36945_H2S in the PVN attenuates sympathetic activity and DISEASE_D006973_hypertensive response, which are partly due to decrease of ROS and PICs within the PVN in high salt-induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertension.
28184907	Regulation of CHEMICAL_D009584_Nitrogen Mustard-Induced Lung Macrophage Activation by CHEMICAL_D014635_Valproic_Acid, a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor.
28184907	CHEMICAL_D009584_Nitrogen mustard (NM)-induced DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury is associated with an accumulation of proinflammatory/cytotoxic M1 and antiinflammatory/wound repair M2 macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue injury and repair.
28184907	Herein, we analyzed the effects of CHEMICAL_D014635_valproic_acid (CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with antiinflammatory and antioxidant activity, on lung macrophages responding to NM.
28184907	Treatment of SPECIES_10116_rats with NM (0.125   mg/kg, i.t.)
28184907	resulted in structural alterations in the lung and a macrophage-rich inflammatory cell infiltrate, at 3 d and 7 d. This was accompanied by expression of GENE_10116)_PCNA, a marker of proliferation, and CYPb5, HO-1, and GENE_10116)_MnSOD, markers of oxidative stress.
28184907	Administration of CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA (300   mg/kg/day; i.p.
28184907	), beginning 30   min after NM, reduced increases in GENE_10116)_PCNA, CYPb5, HO-1, and GENE_10116)_MnSOD.
28184907	This was associated with increases in immature GENE_10116)_CD11b+GENE_10116)_CD43+   M1 macrophages in the lung, and decreases in mature GENE_10116)_CD11b+GENE_10116)_CD43- M2 macrophages 3 d post NM, suggesting delayed maturation and phenotypic switching.
28184907	CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA also attenuated NM-induced increases in lung iNOS+   and GENE_10116)_CCR2+   M1 macrophages, a response correlated with downregulation of GENE_10116)_NOS2, GENE_10116)_IL12B, GENE_10116)_PTGS2, GENE_10116)_MMP_9, and GENE_10116)_CCR2 expression.
28184907	Conversely, numbers of GENE_10116)_CD68+, CHEMICAL__CD163_   , and ATR-1a+   M2 macrophages increased after CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA, along with the expression of GENE_10116)_IL10, GENE_10116)_ApoE, and ATR-1A.
28184907	NM exposure resulted in increased HDAC activity and upregulation of GENE_10116)_HDAC2 and acetylated H3K9 in the lung.
28184907	Whereas CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA blunted the effects of NM on GENE_10116)_HDAC2 expression, histone H3K9 acetylation increased.
28184907	These data suggest that alterations in the balance between histone acetylases and deacetylases contribute to lung macrophage maturation and activation following NM exposure.
28185768	Antitumor activity of CHEMICAL_C000588809_paederosidic_acid in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer cells via inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.
28185768	This study was aimed to investigate antitumor activity of CHEMICAL_C000588809_paederosidic_acid (PA) in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer cells and explore the related mechanisms.
28185768	The anti-proliferative effects of PA on A549  cells were evaluated by CHEMICAL_53233_MTT method and the IC50 values were calculated.
28185768	Furthermore, the PA-induced apoptosis in A549  cells was determined by fluorescence microscope via staining with CHEMICAL_C007293_DAPI and by flow cytometer via staining with CHEMICAL_D016650_FITC conjugated GENE_308_Annexin_V/PI.
28185768	The expression of apoptosis-related or signaling proteins was investigated by Western blotting.
28185768	Our results demonstrated that PA showed significant anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor activity on DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer in  vitro; the mechanisms were involved in inducing mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of GENE_836_caspase_3, GENE_841_caspase_8, GENE_842_caspase_9, GENE_637_Bid, GENE_581_Bax, down-regulation of GENE_596_Bcl_2 and stimulating the release of Cyto-C from mitochondria.
28185768	In addition, GENE_5599_JNK phosphorylation levels significantly increased concomitantly with decrease in Akt phosphorylation after treatment with PA in A549  cells.
28185768	However, GENE_5599_JNK siRNA-transfected cells diminished PA-induced GENE_836;841;842_caspase_3_8_and_9, GENE_637_Bid and GENE_581_Bax activaton while enhanced the GENE_596_Bcl_2 activation.
28185768	Collectively, these results indicated that PA-induced GENE_5599_JNK activation played an important functional role in apoptosis.
28188892	The dental monomer CHEMICAL_C005044_hydroxyethyl_methacrylate (CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA) counteracts lipopolysaccharide-induced GENE_10090)_IL_1b release-Possible role of CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione.
28188892	CHEMICAL_25218_Methacrylate monomers, like CHEMICAL_C005044_2_hydroxyethyl_methacrylate (CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA), are common components of resin based dental materials.
28188892	Leakage of unpolymerized monomers after placement and curing leads to SPECIES_9606_human exposure.
28188892	CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA is known to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced cytokine release.
28188892	In this study we explore a possible role of the antioxidant CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH) in this effect.
28188892	In the RAW 264.7 SPECIES_10090_murine macrophage cell line, CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA (<2mM) did not induce cell death, but reduced cellular CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels, increased cellular ROS and decreased the GENE_10090)_IL_1b release from LPS-stimulated cells.
28188892	Moreover, the GENE_10090)_IL_1b mRNA levels were reduced after 3-6h exposure, suggesting transcriptional effects of CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA.
28188892	The CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH modulators CHEMICAL__butylsulfoximine (CHEMICAL__BSO; inhibitor of CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH synthesis) and CHEMICAL_C029536_2_oxothiazolidine_4_carboxylate (CHEMICAL__OTC; CHEMICAL_D003545_Cysteine precursor) caused a decrease and increase in the LPS-induced GENE_10090)_IL_1b release, respectively, suggesting a role for CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH in negative regulation of LPS-induced GENE_10090)_IL_1b release.
28188892	However, the magnitude and dynamics of the effects of CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA and CHEMICAL__BSO on LPS-induced GENE_10090)_IL_1b release and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH depletion differed considerably.
28188892	Thus, CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH depletion alone could not explain the strong attenuation of LPS-induced GENE_10090)_IL_1b release caused by CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA.
28188892	Formation of DISEASE_C535305_HEMA_protein_conjugates due to the CHEMICAL_29256_thiol reactivity of CHEMICAL_C005044_HEMA emerges as a likely candidate for the molecular mechanism accounting for this effect.
28186389	The role of GENE_10090)_5_HT2c_receptor on CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone-mediated food intake.
28186389	CHEMICAL_D003345_Corticosterone plays an important role in feeding behavior.
28186389	However, its mechanism remains unclear.
28186389	Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone on feeding behavior.
28186389	In this study, cumulative food intake was increased by acute CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone administration in a dose-dependent manner.
28186389	Administration of the GENE_10090)_5_HT2c_receptor agonist CHEMICAL__m_chlorophenylpiperazin (CHEMICAL_C015068_mCPP) reversed the effect of CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone on food intake.
28186389	The anorectic effects of CHEMICAL_C015068_mCPP were also blocked by the GENE_10090)_5_HT2c_receptor antagonist SNP_RS102221_RS102221 in CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone-treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28186389	Both CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone and CHEMICAL_C015068_mCPP increased GENE_10090)_c_Fos expression in hypothalamic nuclei, but not the nucleus of the solitary tract.
28186389	SNP_RS102221_RS102221 inhibited GENE_10090)_c_Fos expression induced by CHEMICAL_C015068_mCPP, but not CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone.
28186389	In addition, CHEMICAL_C015068_mCPP had little effect on TH and GENE_10090)_POMC levels in the hypothalamus.
28186389	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C015068_mCPP antagonized decreasing effect of the leptin produced by CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone.
28186389	Taken together, our findings suggest that GENE_10090)_5_HT2c receptors and leptin may be involved in the effects of CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone-induced DISEASE_D006963_hyperphagia.
28188287	A-to-I RNA Editing Up-regulates SPECIES_9606_Human GENE_1719_Dihydrofolate_Reductase in DISEASE_D001943_Breast_Cancer.
28188287	CHEMICAL_C010920_Dihydrofolate reductase (GENE_1719_DHFR) plays a key role in CHEMICAL_D005492_folate metabolism and is a target molecule of CHEMICAL_D008727_methotrexate.
28188287	An increase in the cellular expression level of GENE_1719_DHFR is one of the mechanisms of DISEASE_D009369_tumor resistance to CHEMICAL_D008727_methotrexate.
28188287	The present study investigated the possibility that CHEMICAL_D000241_adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, which causes CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide conversion by CHEMICAL_D000241_adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (GENE_103_ADAR) enzymes, might modulate GENE_1719_DHFR expression.
28188287	In SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_adenocarcinoma-derived MCF-7 cells, 26 RNA editing sites were identified in the 3'-UTR of GENE_1719_DHFR.
28188287	Knockdown of GENE_103_ADAR1 decreased the RNA editing levels of GENE_1719_DHFR and resulted in a decrease in the GENE_1719_DHFR mRNA and protein levels, indicating that GENE_103_ADAR1 up-regulates GENE_1719_DHFR expression.
28188287	Using a computational analysis, miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p were predicted to bind to the non-edited 3'-UTR of GENE_1719_DHFR but not to the edited sequence.
28188287	The decrease in GENE_1719_DHFR expression by the knockdown of GENE_103_ADAR1 was restored by transfection of antisense oligonucleotides for these miRNAs, suggesting that RNA editing mediated up-regulation of GENE_1719_DHFR requires the function of these miRNAs.
28188287	Interestingly, we observed that the knockdown of GENE_103_ADAR1 decreased cell viability and increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to CHEMICAL_D008727_methotrexate.
28188287	GENE_103_ADAR1 expression levels and the RNA editing levels in the 3'-UTR of GENE_1719_DHFR in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer tissues were higher than those in adjacent normal tissues.
28188287	Collectively, the present study demonstrated that GENE_103_ADAR1 positively regulates the expression of GENE_1719_DHFR by editing the miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p binding sites in the 3'-UTR of GENE_1719_DHFR, enhancing cellular proliferation and resistance to CHEMICAL_D008727_methotrexate.
28193462	Both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signalling may be required for detoxification following ETP class mycotoxin exposure.
28193462	DISEASE_D009181_Fungal_infections (DISEASE_D015651_mycotoxicoses) are a growing global threat for both health and food production, and the available tools for effective detection, monitoring and treatment remain limited.
28193462	Mycotoxins of the so-called ETP class can cause disease in SPECIES_9606_humans (notably immunocompromised clinical SPECIES_9606_patients) and otherwise healthy ruminant production animals.
28193462	Understanding the molecular responses caused by ETP DISEASE_D064420_toxicity responses will inform diagnostics and guide possible interventions.
28193462	Here we provide empirical evidence that exposure of hepatic cells to the ETP mycotoxin CHEMICAL_C001873_Sporidesmin_A may trigger both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signalling, mediated through miRNA regulation, and regulate the particular expression of CYP2C family members.
28193462	These data suggest cellular adaptation to mycotoxin exposure is an epigenetically dependent process leading to the co-ordination of multiple Wnt pathways to drive appropriate downstream detoxification mechanisms.
28189646	Exposure to sub-10nm particles emitted from a biodiesel-fueled diesel engine: In vitro DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and inflammatory potential.
28189646	OBJECTIVES: The inflammatory effects of organic sub-10nm particles generated and emitted from a diesel engine fueled with a biodiesel and a commercial diesel oil are analyzed in this paper.
28189646	Diesel combustion is the major sources of ultrafine particles (UFP) in the environment, particularly in urbanized areas.
28189646	In the last years, there is an increasing use of biomass-derived fuels because they are a renewable source of energy that may mitigate climate change through the reduction of net CHEMICAL_D002245_CO2 with respect to conventional fossil fuels.
28189646	Although there is a general agreement on biofuels ability to reduce conventional pollutants, new and potentially harmful pollutants can be formed during biofuel combustion.
28189646	In particular, the emission of sub-10nm particles is strongly increased with respect to that of larger soot particles.
28189646	METHODS: Organic sub-10nm particles are separated from larger sizes particulate matter by collection in water suspension for toxicological and inflammatory tests.
28189646	After exposure to sub-10nm particles, the effects on proliferation, apoptosis and secretion of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors networks production is analyzed in immortalized non-tumorigenic SPECIES_9606_human dermal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and SPECIES_9606_human alveolar epithelial-like cells (A549).
28189646	RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Nanoparticles exert different cytotoxic effects in the two cell lines, suggesting that the dermal way of exposure is more sensitive than the inhalant way.
28189646	These differences are most evident in the secretion of pro-inflammatory, angiogenic and proliferative cytokines and chemokines whose expression is more finely modulated in HaCaT cells compared to A-549 cells.
28189646	Considering the size of these particles, it is important to promote the culture of prevention also for the dermal way in particularly exposed workers.
28189720	Toxic effects of CHEMICAL_C057862_microcystin_LR on the development of prostate in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28189720	Although it is well known that CHEMICAL_C057862_microcystin_LR (CHEMICAL__MC_LR) may cause SPECIES_9606_male reproductive toxicity, less is known on its potential impact on the development of prostate.
28189720	In this study, from the 12th day in the embryonic period to the 21st day after birth, 4 randomly assigned groups of pregnant SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 50 g/L of CHEMICAL__MC_LR through drinking water followed by the analyses of their 30- and 90-day-old SPECIES_9606_male offspring.
28189720	The result showed that CHEMICAL__MC_LR could enter and be accumulated in the offsprings prostate.
28189720	Using serological, morphological, and immunohistochemical analysis, we explored the effect of perinatal CHEMICAL__MC_LR exposure on the prostate development of SPECIES_9606_male offspring.
28189720	With increasing CHEMICAL__MC_LR concentrations, the 30 day-old SPECIES_9606_male offspring experienced decreased prostate index, increased serum CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels, decreased serum CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol levels, and increased the serum CHEMICAL_50113_androgen/CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen ratio.
28189720	Morphological findings showed a significant acini DISEASE_C566873_branching_defect in both the10 and 50 g/L group and increasing CHEMICAL__MC_LR exposures induced augmented expression of CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor (GENE_367_AR) and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor a (GENE_2099_ERa).
28189720	For the 90-day group, CHEMICAL__MC_LR exposure resulted in decreased physiological indexes including prostate index and the serum CHEMICAL_50113_androgen/CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen ratio.
28189720	Pathological changes could be observed in prostate tissues of SPECIES_10090_mice treated with CHEMICAL__MC_LR.
28189720	Increased expression of GENE_367_AR and GENE_2099_ERa was also observed.
28189720	Taken together, our results demonstrated that perinatal CHEMICAL__MC_LR exposure interfered with the development of the prostate in the offspring, evidenced by DISEASE_D053448_prostatic_necrosis, DISEASE_D006965_hyperplasia, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis, anddisordered hormone conversion of CHEMICAL_50113_androgen to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen inducing imbalance of CHEMICAL_50113_androgen and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen in the prostate may be one of the potential mechanisms of CHEMICAL__MC_LR disrupting prostate development.
28189721	CHEMICAL_C024565_1_2_Dichloroethane impairs CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and lipid homeostasis in the livers of NIH SPECIES_10090_Swiss_mice.
28189721	Excessive exposure to CHEMICAL_C024565_1_2_Dichloroethane (CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE), a chlorinated organic toxicant, can lead to DISEASE_D008107_liver_dysfunction.
28189721	To fully explore the mechanism of CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE-induced DISEASE_D008107_hepatic_abnormalities, 30 SPECIES_9606_male National Institutes of Health (NIH) SPECIES_10090_Swiss_mice were exposed to 0, 350, or 700mg/m3 of CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE, via inhalation, 6h/day for 28days.
28189721	Increased liver/body weight ratios, as well as serum GENE_10090)_AST and serum GENE_10090)_ALT activity were observed in the 350 and 700mg/m3 CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE exposure group SPECIES_10090_mice, compared with the control group SPECIES_10090_mice.
28189721	In addition, decreased body weights were observed in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to 700mg/m3 CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE, compared with control SPECIES_10090_mice.
28189721	Exposure to 350 and 700mg/m3 CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE also led to significant accumulation of hepatic glycogen, CHEMICAL_D005230_free_fatty_acids (CHEMICAL_42638_FFA) and CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides, elevation of blood CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride and CHEMICAL_42638_FFA levels, and decreases in blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose levels.
28189721	Results from microarray analysis indicated that the decreases in GENE_2538_glucose_6_phosphatase_catalytic_subunit (GENE_2538_G6PC) and liver glycogen phosphorylase (GENE_5836_PYGL) expression, mediated by the activation of GENE_207_AKT_serine_threonine_kinase_1 (GENE_207_Akt1), might be responsible for the hepatic glycogen accumulation and DISEASE_D005234_steatosis.
28189721	Further in vitro study demonstrated that CHEMICAL_27869_2_chloroacetic_acid (CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE metabolite), rather than CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE, up-regulated GENE_207_Akt1 phosphorylation and suppressed GENE_2538_G6PC and GENE_5836_PYGL expression, resulting in hepatocellular glycogen accumulation.
28189721	These results suggest that hepatic CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and lipid homeostasis are impaired by CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE exposure via down-regulation of GENE_5836_PYGL and GENE_2538_G6PC expression, which may be primarily mediated by the CHEMICAL_27869_2_chloroacetic_acid-activated GENE_207_Akt1 pathway.
28196854	Hypothalamic transcriptomic alterations in male and female California SPECIES_10090_mice (Peromyscus californicus) developmentally exposed to CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A or CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinyl_estradiol.
28196854	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) prevalent in many household items.
28196854	Rodent models and SPECIES_9606_human epidemiological studies have linked this chemical to DISEASE_D019954_neurobehavior_impairments.
28196854	In California SPECIES_10090_mice, developmental exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA results in DISEASE_D030342_sociosexual_disorders at adulthood, including communication and biparental DISEASE_D009461_care_deficits, behaviors that are primarily regulated by the hypothalamus.
28196854	Thus, we sought to examine the transcriptomic profile in this brain region of juvenile male and female California SPECIES_10090_mice offspring exposed from periconception through lactation to CHEMICAL__BPA or CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinyl_estradiol (EE, CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen present in birth control pills and considered a positive CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen control for CHEMICAL__BPA studies).
28196854	Two weeks prior to breeding, P0 females were fed a control diet, or this diet supplemented with 50  mg CHEMICAL__BPA/kg feed weight or 0.1 ppb EE, and continued on the diets through lactation.
28196854	At weaning, brains from male and female offspring were collected, hypothalamic RNA isolated, and RNA-seq analysis performed.
28196854	Results indicate that CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL_D004997_EE groups clustered separately from controls with CHEMICAL__BPA and EE exposure leading to unique set of signature gene profiles.
28196854	GENE_10090)_Kcnd3 was downregulated in the hypothalamus of CHEMICAL__BPA- and EE-exposed females, whereas GENE_10090)_Tbl2, GENE_10090)_Topors, GENE_10090)_Kif3a, and GENE_10090)_Phactr2 were upregulated in these groups.
28196854	Comparison of transcripts differentially expressed in CHEMICAL__BPA and EE groups revealed significant enrichment of gene ontology terms associated with microtubule-based processes.
28196854	Current results show that perinatal exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA or EE can result in several transcriptomic alterations, including those associated with microtubule functions, in the hypothalamus of California SPECIES_10090_mice.
28196854	It remains to be determined whether these genes mediate CHEMICAL__BPA-induced DISEASE_D019958_behavioral_disruptions.
28192182	SPECIES_9606_Male reproductive toxicity of CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI: In-utero exposure to CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI at the critical window of testis differentiation represses the expression of Sertoli cell tight junction proteins and hormone receptors in adult F<sub>1</sub>progeny SPECIES_10116_rats.
28192182	The effect of gestational exposure to CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI (occupational/environmental pollutant and target to Sertoli cells(SC)) was tested in a SPECIES_10116_rat model during the testicular differentiation from the bipotential gonad may interrupt spermatogenesis by disrupting SC tight junctions(TJ) and it's proteins and hormone receptors.
28192182	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were exposed to 50/100/200ppm CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI through drinking water during embryonic days 9-14.
28192182	On Postnatal day 120, testes were subjected to ion exchange chromatographic analysis and revealed increased level of CrIII in SCs and germ cells, serum and testicular interstitial fluid(GENE_7301_TIF).
28192182	Microscopic analyses showed seminiferous tubules atrophy and disruption of SC TJ, which also recorded decreased CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone in GENE_7301_TIF.
28192182	mRNA and Protein expression analyses attested decreased level of GENE_2492_Fshr, Ar, GENE_100506658_occludin and GENE_5010_claudin_11 in SCs.
28192182	Immunofluorescent detection revealed weak signal of TJ proteins.
28192182	Taken together, we concluded that gestational exposure to CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI interferes with the expression of SC TJ proteins due to attenuated expression of hormone receptors.
28201806	Derivation and Evaluation of Putative Adverse Outcome Pathways for the Effects of Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors on Reproductive Processes in Female SPECIES_7955_Fish.
28201806	Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are ubiquitous in aquatic systems and have been detected in SPECIES_7955_fish tissues.
28201806	The exposure of SPECIES_7955_fish to these pharmaceuticals is concerning because COX inhibitors disrupt the synthesis of CHEMICAL_D011453_prostaglandins (CHEMICAL__PGs), which modulate a variety of essential biological functions, including reproduction.
28201806	In this study, we investigated the effects of well-characterized SPECIES_9606_mammalian COX inhibitors on female SPECIES_90988_fathead_minnow reproductive health.
28201806	SPECIES_7955_Fish (n   =   8) were exposed for 96   h to water containing CHEMICAL_D007213_indomethacin (IN; 100   g/l), CHEMICAL_D007052_ibuprofen (IB; 200   g/l) or CHEMICAL_C105934_celecoxib (CX; 20   g/l), and evaluated for effects on liver metabolome and ovarian gene expression.
28201806	Metabolomic profiles of IN, IB and CX were not significantly different from control or one another.
28201806	Exposure to IB and CX resulted in differential expression of comparable numbers of genes (IB   =   433, CX   =   545).
28201806	In contrast, 2558 genes were differentially expressed in IN-treated SPECIES_7955_fish.
28201806	Functional analyses (canonical pathway and gene set enrichment) indicated extensive effects of IN on PG synthesis pathway, oocyte meiosis, and several other processes consistent with physiological roles of CHEMICAL__PGs.
28201806	Transcriptomic data were congruent with PG data; IN-reduced plasma PG F2a concentration, whereas IB and CX did not.
28201806	Five putative AOPs were developed linking the assumed molecular initiating event of COX inhibition, with PG reduction and the adverse outcome of reproductive failure via reduction of: (1) ovulation, (2) reproductive behaviors mediated by exogenous or endogenous CHEMICAL__PGs, and (3) oocyte maturation in SPECIES_7955_fish.
28201806	These pathways were developed using, in part, empirical data from the present study and other publicly available data.
28202386	CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat and maneb co-exposure induces noradrenergic locus coeruleus DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration through CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase-mediated microglial activation.
28202386	Co-exposure to CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat (PQ) and maneb (Mb) has been shown to increase the risk of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) and dopaminergic (DA) DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is observed in PQ and Mb-treated experimental animals.
28202386	The loss of noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC/NE) neurons in brainstem is a common feature shared by multiple DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_diseases, including DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28202386	However, whether PQ and Mb is able to damage LC/NE neurons remains undefined.
28202386	In this study, SPECIES_10090_mice treated with combined PQ and Mb displayed progressive DISEASE_D019636_LC_NE_neurodegeneration.
28202386	Time course studies revealed that the activation of microglia preceded DISEASE_D019636_LC_NE_neurodegeneration.
28202386	Mechanistically, the activation of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase contributed to microglial activation and subsequent DISEASE_D019636_LC_NE_neurodegeneration.
28202386	We found that PQ and Mb co-exposure induced activation of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase as shown by increased CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide production and membrane translocation of GENE_653361_p47phox, a cytosolic subunit of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase.
28202386	Inhibition of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase by CHEMICAL_C056165_apocynin, a widely used CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suppressed microglial activation and gene expressions of proinflammatory factors.
28202386	Furthermore, reduced activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway was observed in CHEMICAL_C056165_apocynin-treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28202386	More importantly, inhibition of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase by CHEMICAL_C056165_apocynin afforded LC/NE neuroprotection against PQ and Mb-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28202386	Thus, our findings revealed the critical role CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase-mediated microglial activation in driving DISEASE_D019636_LC_NE_neurodegeneration induced by PQ and Mb, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of environmental toxins-induced DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28202387	CHEMICAL_C500838_Varenicline enhances oxidized LDL uptake by increasing expression of GENE_4973_LOX_1 and GENE_948_CD36 scavenger receptors through a7 GENE_1137_nAChR in macrophages.
28202387	CHEMICAL_C500838_Varenicline is a widely used and effective drug for smoking cessation.
28202387	It is a partial agonist of the a4b2 nicotinic CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine receptor (GENE_1137_nAChR) and full agonist of a7 GENE_1137_nAChR.
28202387	We have reported that CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline aggravates formation of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerotic_plaques through a7 GENE_10090)_nAChR in GENE_10090)_apolipoprotein_E knockout SPECIES_10090_mice.
28202387	However, little is known about its effects on macrophages in DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerotic_plaques.
28202387	Here, we ascertained whether CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline promotes oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake in SPECIES_10090_mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro and clarified its mechanism.
28202387	We investigated the effects of CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline (1-10 M) on expression of scavenger receptors (GENE_10090)_lectin_like_oxidized_LDL_receptor_1 (GENE_10090)_LOX_1), DISEASE_D003027_cluster_of_differentiation (DISEASE_D003027_CD) 36 and GENE_10090)_scavenger_receptor_class_A (GENE_10090)_SR_A)) in RAW264.7 cells.
28202387	Expression of protein and mRNA was determined by western blotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively.
28202387	Effects of CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline (10 M) on oxLDL uptake were examined by counting the number of macrophages stained with CHEMICAL_C011049_oil_red_O and CHEMICAL_D006416_hematoxylin.
28202387	CHEMICAL_C500838_Varenicline significantly increased expression of the protein and mRNA of GENE_10090)_LOX_1 and GENE_10090)_CD36, but not GENE_10090)_SR_A, in RAW264.7 cells, and increased oxLDL uptake in macrophages.
28202387	These effects of CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline were blocked significantly by an a7 GENE_1137_nAChR antagonist, CHEMICAL_C054634_methyllycaconitine (CHEMICAL__MLA) (50nM), but not by an a4b2 GENE_1137_nAChR antagonist, CHEMICAL__dihydro_b_erythroidine_hydrobromide (CHEMICAL__DHbE) (1 M).
28202387	These data suggest that CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline promotes oxLDL uptake by upregulating expression of GENE_4973_LOX_1 and GENE_948_CD36 through a7 GENE_1137_nAChR in macrophages.
28202387	We found that CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline significantly activated GENE_26417;26413_extracellular_signal_regulated_kinase_1_2 (GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells.
28202387	This activation was blocked by CHEMICAL__MLA but not CHEMICAL__DHbE.
28202387	Therefore, GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2-NF-kB signaling pathway is highly likely to be responsible for CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline-induced upregulation of GENE_4973_LOX_1 and GENE_948_CD36 expression through a7 GENE_1137_nAChR in macrophages.
28202387	These processes probably contribute to CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline-aggravated DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerotic_plaque formation.
28202387	Hence, an increased risk of cardiovascular events upon CHEMICAL_C500838_varenicline treatment could occur, and must be considered in SPECIES_9606_patients (especially those suffering from DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_diseases).
28208108	Dietary administration of EDC mixtures: A focus on fish lipid metabolism.
28208108	Many SPECIES_9606_man-made chemical compounds are recognized as endocrine disruptors and once released into the environment are likely to spread and bioaccumulate in wild species.
28208108	Due to their lipophilic nature, these substances pass through the cell membrane or bind to specific receptors activating physiological responses that in the long run can cause reproductive DISEASE_D003072_impairment_physiological_disorders, including the occurrence of DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_syndromes.
28208108	One significant source of contamination is represented by the consumption of polluted food.
28208108	As a consequence, different environmental pollutants, with similar or different modes of action, can accumulate in organisms and biomagnify along the food web, finally targeting SPECIES_9606_humans.
28208108	The aim of this study was to analyze, under controlled conditions, the effects induced by the consumption of contaminated diets, focusing on the effects exerted at hepatic level.
28208108	Juvenile seabream were fed for 21days a diet enriched with different combinations of pollutants, CHEMICAL_C025256_nonylphenol (NP), CHEMICAL__tert_octylphenol (CHEMICAL__t_OP) and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA).
28208108	The different diets containing 5mg/kg bw of each contaminant, were formulated as follows: NP+tOP, CHEMICAL__BPA+NP, CHEMICAL__BPA+tOP and NP+CHEMICAL__BPA_tOP (NBO).
28208108	EDCs, at the doses administered, showed low biomagnification factor (BMF), suggesting that these pollutants hardly accumulate in muscles.
28208108	The results obtained at hepatic level pinpointed the steatotic effect of all the administered diets, associated to a modulation of the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (ppars, fas, lpl, and GENE_3991_hsl).
28208108	Results were compared to those obtained in previous studies in which fish were fed single pollutants evidencing that the administration of mixture of contaminants exerts a milder lipogenic effect, highlighting the contrasting/antagonistic interaction establishing among chemicals.
28208108	Noteworthy was the setup of a new chromatographic method to detect the presence of the selected chemical in fish muscle and the application of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis to evaluate pollutant-induced changes in the liver macromolecular building.
28206643	In Vivo Exposure to Inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic Alters Differentiation-Specific Gene Expression of GENE_10090)_Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells in SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6J SPECIES_10090_Mouse Model.
28206643	The number of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic modalities has grown in recent years.
28206643	GENE_10090)_Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (ASCs) can be isolated and expanded relatively easily as compared with their bone-marrow counterparts, making them a particularly promising source of MSCs.
28206643	And although the biological mechanisms surrounding ASCs are actively being investigated, little is known about the effects that in vivo environmental exposures might have on their ability to properly differentiate.
28206643	Therefore, we hypothesized that ASCs isolated from SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic (iAs) would have an altered response towards adipogenic, osteogenic, and/or chondrogenic differentiation.
28206643	To test this hypothesis, SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6J SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice were provided drinking water containing 0, 300, or 1000   ppb iAs.
28206643	ASCs were then isolated and differentiated, which was assessed by immunocytochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
28206643	Our results showed that total urinary CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic equilibrated within 1 week of exposure to iAs and was maintained throughout the study.
28206643	ASCs isolated from each exposure group maintained differentiation capabilities for each lineage.
28206643	The magnitude of differentiation-specific gene expression, however, appeared to be concentration dependent.
28206643	For osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, differentiation-specific gene expression decreased, whereas adipogenesis showed a biphasic response with an initial decrease followed by an increase in adipogenic-related gene expression following iAs exposure.
28206643	These results suggest that the level in which differentiation-specific genes are induced within these stromal cells might be sensitive to environmental contaminants.
28206643	These findings highlight the need to take into account potential environmental exposures prior to selecting stromal cell SPECIES_9606_donors, so ASCs can achieve optimal efficiency in regenerative therapy applications.
28212817	In vivo DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL__copper_oxide, CHEMICAL_C047365_lead_oxide and CHEMICAL_D015034_zinc_oxide nanoparticles acting in different combinations and its attenuation with a complex of innocuous bio-protectors.
28212817	Stable suspensions of CHEMICAL__metal_oxide nanoparticles (Me-NPs) obtained by laser ablation of 99.99% pure CHEMICAL_D003300_copper, CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc or lead under a layer of deionized water were used separately, in three binary combinations and a triple combination in two independent experiments on SPECIES_10116_rats.
28212817	In one of the experiments the SPECIES_10116_rats were instilled with Me-NPs intratracheally (i.t.)
28212817	(for performing a broncho-alveolar lavage in 24h to estimate the cytological and biochemical indices of the response of the lower airways), while in the other, Me-NPs were repeatedly injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
28212817	18 times during 6 weeks (for estimating the accumulation of corresponding metals in the blood and their excretion with urine and feces and for assessing subchronic intoxication by a large number of functional and morphological indices).
28212817	Mathematical description of the results from both experiments with the help of the Response Surface Methodology has shown that, as well as in the case of any other binary toxic combinations previously investigated by us, the response of the organism to a simultaneous exposure to any two of the Me-NPs under study is characterized by complex interactions between all possible types of combined DISEASE_D064420_toxicity (additivity, subadditivity or superadditivity of unidirectional action and different variants of opposite effects) depending on which effect it is estimated for as well as on the levels of the effect and dose.
28212817	With any third Me-NP species acting in the background, the type of combined DISEASE_D064420_toxicity displayed by the other two may change significantly (as in the earlier described case of a triple combination of soluble metal salts).
28212817	It is shown that various harmful effects produced by CHEMICAL__CuO-NP+CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO-NP+CHEMICAL_61603_PbO-NP combination may be substantially attenuated by giving SPECIES_10116_rats per os a complex of innocuous bioactive substances theoretically expected to provide a protective integral and/or metal-specific effect during one month before i.t.

28209544	GENE_10090)_Sestrin2 protects against CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28209544	CHEMICAL_D000082_Acetaminophen (CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP) DISEASE_D062787_overdose accounts for half of the cases of acute DISEASE_D017093_liver_failure worldwide.
28209544	We previously reported that GENE_10090)_Sestrin2 (GENE_10090)_Sesn2) protects against CHEMICAL_60313_d_galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide-induced acute DISEASE_D017114_fulminant_liver_failure.
28209544	In this study, we demonstrated that GENE_10090)_Sesn2 protects CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in SPECIES_10090_mice, using a recombinant SPECIES_10535_adenovirus encoding GENE_10090)_Sesn2 (Ad-GENE_10090)_Sesn2).
28209544	First, we found that treatment of SPECIES_10090_mice with toxic levels of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP significantly reduced GENE_10090)_Sesn2 expression.
28209544	Tail-vein injection with Ad-GENE_10090)_Sesn2 inhibited CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced serum CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine aminotransferase and CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate aminotransferase levels and markedly reduced hepatocyte degeneration and DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory_cell_infiltration.
28209544	Additionally, CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione depletion and reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species generation were inhibited by Ad-GENE_10090)_Sesn2 treatment.
28209544	Consistently, hepatic inflammatory gene expression and proinflammatory cytokine levels were also inhibited in GENE_10090)_Sesn2-infected SPECIES_10090_mice, and we observed reduced CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-mediated apoptotic signaling by terminal transferase-mediated CHEMICAL_17625_dUTP nick-end labeling staining of the hepatic tissue.
28209544	At a high dose of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP, the mortality rate of Ad-GENE_10090)_Sesn2-infected SPECIES_10090_mice was significantly lower than that of control SPECIES_10090_mice.
28209544	Furthermore, GENE_10090)_Sesn2 prevented CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced damage through suppression of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation.
28209544	Therefore, GENE_10090)_Sesn2 exerted a protective effect against CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_damage by inhibiting oxidative stress and proinflammatory signaling.
28213090	CHEMICAL_D006034_Glycyrrhetinic_acid attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced DISEASE_D017114_fulminant_hepatic_failure in CHEMICAL_60313_d_galactosamine-sensitized SPECIES_10090_mice by up-regulating expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M. CHEMICAL_D006034_Glycyrrhetinic_acid (GA), the main active ingredient of licorice, reportedly has anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties, but its molecular mechanisms remain be elusive.
28213090	In the present study, Balb/c SPECIES_10090_mice were pretreated with GA (10, 30, or 100mg/kg) 1h before lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/CHEMICAL_60313_d_galactosamine (D-GENE_10090)_GalN) administration.
28213090	In other in vitro experiment, RAW264.7 macrophages were pretreated with GA before LPS exposure.
28213090	The mortality, hepatic tissue histology, serum CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine aminotransferase (GENE_10090)_ALT) and CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate aminotransferase (GENE_10090)_AST) were analyzed.
28213090	GENE_10090)_Toll_like_receptor_4 (GENE_10090)_TLR4), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs), activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-kB, and production of GENE_10090)_TNF_a were assessed by flow cytometry, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.
28213090	Our results showed that pretreatment with GA protected SPECIES_10090_mice against LPS/D-GENE_10090)_GalN-induced DISEASE_D017114_fulminant_hepatic_failure (DISEASE_D017114_FHF), including a dose-dependent alleviation of mortality and GENE_10090)_ALT/GENE_10090)_AST elevation, ameliorating hepatic pathological damage, and decreasing GENE_10090)_TNF_a release.
28213090	Moreover, GA inhibited LPS-induced activation of MAPKs and NF-kB in response to LPS, but the expression of GENE_10090)_TLR4 was not affected in vivo and in vitro.
28213090	Notably, GA pretreatment in vivo suppressed GENE_10090)_IRAK_1 activity while inducing GENE_10090)_IRAK_M expression.
28213090	Silencing of GENE_10090)_IRAK_M expression with siRNA blocked these beneficial effects of GA on the activation of MAPKs and NF-kB as well as GENE_10090)_TNF_a production in LPS-primed macrophages.
28213090	Taken together, we conclude that GA could prevent LPS/D-GENE_10090)_GalN-induced DISEASE_D017114_FHF.
28213090	The underlying mechanisms may be related to up-regulation of GENE_10090)_IRAK_M, which in turn caused deactivation of GENE_10090)_IRAK_1 and subsequent MAPKs and NF-kB, resulting in inhibiting GENE_10090)_TNF_a production.
28213091	Convergence of GENE_10090)_hepcidin deficiency, systemic CHEMICAL_D007501_iron overloading, CHEMICAL_D006418_heme accumulation, and GENE_10090)_REV-ERBa/b activation in CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor-elicited hepatotoxicity.
28213091	Persistent GENE_10090)_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor (GENE_10090)_AhR) agonists elicit dose-dependent hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28213091	CHEMICAL_D007501_Iron (CHEMICAL__Fe) promotes GENE_10090)_AhR-mediated oxidative stress by catalyzing reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) production.
28213091	To further characterize the role of CHEMICAL__Fe in GENE_196_AhR-mediated hepatotoxicity, SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6 SPECIES_10090_mice were orally gavaged with SPECIES_4182_sesame oil vehicle or 0.01-30 g/kg CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) every 4days for 28days.
28213091	Duodenal epithelial and hepatic RNA-Seq data were integrated with hepatic GENE_10090)_AhR ChIP-Seq, capillary electrophoresis protein measurements, and clinical chemistry analyses.
28213091	CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD dose-dependently repressed hepatic expression of GENE_10090)_hepcidin (GENE_10090)_Hamp and GENE_10090)_Hamp2), the master regulator of systemic CHEMICAL__Fe homeostasis, resulting in a 2.6-fold increase in serum CHEMICAL__Fe with accumulating CHEMICAL__Fe spilling into urine.
28213091	Total hepatic CHEMICAL__Fe levels were negligibly increased while transferrin saturation remained unchanged.
28213091	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD elicited dose-dependent gene expression changes in CHEMICAL_D006418_heme biosynthesis including the induction of CHEMICAL_D000622_aminolevulinic_acid synthase 1 (GENE_10090)_Alas1) and repression of GENE_10090)_uroporphyrinogen_decarboxylase (GENE_10090)_Urod), leading to a 50% increase in hepatic hemin and a 13.2-fold increase in total urinary CHEMICAL_D011166_porphyrins.
28213091	Consistent with this CHEMICAL_D006418_heme accumulation, differential gene expression suggests that CHEMICAL_D006418_heme activated GENE_10090)_BACH1 and GENE_10090)_REV-ERBa/b, causing induction of GENE_10090)_heme_oxygenase_1 (GENE_10090)_Hmox1) and repression of CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid biosynthesis, respectively.
28213091	Collectively, these results suggest that GENE_10090)_Hamp repression, CHEMICAL__Fe accumulation, and increased CHEMICAL_D006418_heme levels converge to promote oxidative stress and the progression of CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-elicited hepatotoxicity.
28214749	Impairment in the mesohippocampal CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine circuit following exposure to the brominated flame retardant, CHEMICAL__HBCDD.
28214749	Many chemicals have been used to increase the safety of consumer products by reducing their flammability and risk for ignition.
28214749	Recent focus on brominated flame retardants, such as CHEMICAL_D055768_polybrominated_diphenyl_ethers (CHEMICAL_D055768_PBDEs) has shown them to contribute to DISEASE_D019954_neurobehavioral_deficits in SPECIES_9606_children, including learning and memory.
28214749	As the manufacture and use of CHEMICAL_D055768_PBDEs have been reduced, replacement chemicals, such as CHEMICAL_C089796_hexabromocyclododecane (CHEMICAL__HBCDD) have been substituted.
28214749	Our current study evaluated the DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity of CHEMICAL__HBCDD, concentrating on dopaminergic innervation to the hippocampus.
28214749	Using an in vivo model, we exposed SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice to CHEMICAL__HBCDD and then assessed alterations to the CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine synapse 6 weeks later.
28214749	These exposures elicited significant reductions in presynaptic dopaminergic proteins, including TH, GENE_1312_COMT, GENE_4129_MAO_B, GENE_6531_DAT, GENE_6571_VMAT2, and GENE_6622_alpha_synuclein.
28214749	In contrast, postsynaptic CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine receptors were not impaired.
28214749	These findings suggest that the mesohippocampal CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine circuit is vulnerable to CHEMICAL__HBCDD and the CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine terminal may be a selective target for alteration.
28215542	CHEMICAL_D006581_Hexachlorobenzene alters cell cycle by regulating GENE_3429_p27-cyclin E-GENE_1017_CDK2 and GENE_6714_c_Src-GENE_3429_p27 protein complexes.
28215542	CHEMICAL_D006581_Hexachlorobenzene (CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB) is an CHEMICAL__organochlorine pollutant widely distributed in the environment around the entire world.
28215542	Previous reports from our group and others have demonstrated that this compound is as an endocrine disruptor.
28215542	We have also reported that CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB presents a co-carcinogenic effect in CHEMICAL_50102_N_Nitroso_N_methyl_urea-induced mammary DISEASE_D009369_tumours in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28215542	In this work, we studied the effects of CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB on cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulating protein expression in the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7.
28215542	Here, we show that CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB alters cell cycle in a concentration-dependent way.
28215542	The lowest assessed concentration (0.005 M) promotes the cell cycle progression, enhances GENE_595_cyclin_D1 expression, and reduces the nuclear localization of GENE_3429_p27 accompanied by an increased interaction between GENE_3429_p27 and GENE_1445_c_Src_kinase.
28215542	On the other hand, 5 M CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB delays the cell cycle progression and promotes the formation of the cyclin E-GENE_1017_CDK2-GENE_3429_p27 protein complex.
28215542	Our results show that CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB stimulates cell proliferation through cell cycle modulation and GENE_6714_c_Src involvement in MCF-7 cells.
28215542	Here, we report for the first time that differential mechanisms of action of CHEMICAL_D006581_HCB on mammary cell cycle progression are triggered at different concentrations of this pollutant.
28219650	Dendritic cells' death induced by contact sensitizers is controlled by GENE_10090)_Nrf2 and depends on CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione levels.
28219650	Dendritic cells (DC) are known to play a major role during contact allergy induced by contact sensitizers (CS).
28219650	Our previous studies showed that GENE_10090)_Nrf2 was induced in DC and controlled allergic skin inflammation in SPECIES_10090_mice in response to chemicals.
28219650	In this work, we raised the question of the role of GENE_10090)_Nrf2 in response to a stress provoked by chemical sensitizers in DC.
28219650	We used two well-described chemical sensitizers, CHEMICAL_D004137_dinitrochlorobenzene (CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB) and CHEMICAL_C012843_cinnamaldehyde (CHEMICAL__CinA), known to have different chemical reactivity and mechanism of action.
28219650	First, we performed a RT-qPCR array showing that CHEMICAL__CinA was a higher inducer of immune and detoxification genes compared to CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB.
28219650	Interestingly, in the absence of GENE_10090)_Nrf2, gene expression was dramatically affected in response to CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB but was slightly affected in response to CHEMICAL__CinA.
28219650	These observations prompted us to study DC's cell death in response to both chemicals.
28219650	CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB and CHEMICAL__CinA increased apoptotic cells and decreased living cells in the absence of GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28219650	The characterization of DC apoptosis induced by both CS involved the mitochondrial-dependent caspase pathway and was regulated via GENE_10090)_Nrf2 in response to both chemicals.
28219650	Oxidative stress induced by CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB, and leading to cell death, was regulated by GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28219650	Unlike CHEMICAL__CinA, CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB treatment provoked a significant reduction of intracellular CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels and up-regulated GENE_10090)_bcl_2 gene expression, under the control of GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28219650	This work underlies that chemical reactivity may control GENE_10090)_Nrf2-dependent gene expression leading to different cytoprotective mechanisms in DC.
28219760	Maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_C023036_perfluorooctanoic_acid inhibits luteal function via oxidative stress and apoptosis in pregnant SPECIES_10090_mice.
28219760	CHEMICAL_C023036_Perfluorooctanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA) is a synthetic perfluorinated compound, which has been reported to exert adverse effect on the pregnancy.
28219760	However, whether it is associated with alteration of luteal function remains unknown.
28219760	SPECIES_10090_Mice were administered CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA by gavage from gestational days (GD) 1-7 or 13.
28219760	CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment did not significantly affect numbers of SPECIES_6239_embryo implantation.
28219760	Nevertheless, on GD 13, 10mg/kg CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment significantly increased numbers of resorbed SPECIES_6239_embryo.
28219760	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposure markedly reduced serum CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone levels but did not affect CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol levels.
28219760	Treatment also showed concomitant decreases in transcript levels for key steroidogenic enzymes, and reduced numbers and sizes of corpora lutea.
28219760	In addition, CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA administration inhibited activities of CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase and GENE_847_catalase, and increased generation of CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide and CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde, and down-regulated level of GENE_596_Bcl_2 and up-regulated GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_581_BAX proteins.
28219760	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposure significantly inhibits luteal function via oxidative stress and apoptosis in pregnant SPECIES_10090_mice.
28219012	GENE_7299_Tyrosinase-Catalyzed Oxidation of the DISEASE_D004409_Leukoderma_Inducing Agent Raspberry CHEMICAL_17087_Ketone Produces CHEMICAL___E_4_3_Oxo_1_butenyl_1_2_benzoquinone: Implications for Melanocyte DISEASE_D064420_Toxicity.
28219012	The exposure of SPECIES_9606_human skin to CHEMICAL_68656_4_4_hydroxyphenyl_2_butanone (CHEMICAL_C035522_raspberry_ketone, RK) is known to cause chemical/occupational DISEASE_C536955_leukoderma.
28219012	RK has a structure closely related to CHEMICAL_C000598249_4_4_hydroxyphenyl_2_butanol (CHEMICAL_C115945_rhododendrol), a skin whitening agent that was found to cause DISEASE_C536955_leukoderma in the skin of consumers in 2013.
28219012	CHEMICAL_C115945_Rhododendrol is a good substrate for GENE_7299_tyrosinase and causes a GENE_7299_tyrosinase-dependent DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity to melanocytes, cells that are responsible for skin pigmentation.
28219012	Therefore, it is expected that RK exerts its DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity to melanocytes through the GENE_7299_tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation to cytotoxic CHEMICAL__o_quinones.
28219012	The results of this study demonstrate that the oxidation of RK by mushroom GENE_7299_tyrosinase rapidly produces CHEMICAL__4_3_oxobutyl_1_2_benzoquinone (CHEMICAL__RK_quinone), which is converted within 10-20 min to CHEMICAL___E_4_3_oxo_1_butenyl_1_2_benzoquinone (GENE_4168_DBL-quinone).
28219012	These CHEMICAL_D011809_quinones were identified as their corresponding catechols after reduction by CHEMICAL_D001205_ascorbic_acid.
28219012	CHEMICAL__RK_quinone and GENE_4168_DBL-quinone quantitatively bind to the small CHEMICAL__thiol_N_acetyl_l_cysteine to form CHEMICAL_29256_thiol adducts and can also bind to the CHEMICAL_29256_thiol protein bovine serum albumin through its CHEMICAL_23511_cysteinyl residue.
28219012	CHEMICAL__DBL_quinone is more reactive than CHEMICAL__RK_quinone, as judged by their half-lives (6.2 min vs 10.5 min, respectively), and decays rapidly to form an oligomeric pigment (RK-oligomer).
28219012	The RK-oligomer can oxidize CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH to CHEMICAL_D019803_GSSG with a concomitant production of CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide, indicating its pro-oxidant activity, similar to that of the RD-oligomer.
28219012	These results suggest that RK is cytotoxic to melanocytes through the binding of RK-derived CHEMICAL_D011809_quinones to CHEMICAL_29256_thiol proteins and the pro-oxidant activity of the RK-oligomer.
28219700	Inhibition of ROS production, autophagy or apoptosis signaling reversed the anticancer properties of Antrodia salmonea in triple-negative DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells.
28219700	We investigated the in  vitro and in  vivo anticancer properties of Antrodia salmonea (AS), a well-known edible/medicinal mushroom in Taiwan, on SPECIES_9606_human triple-negative DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells and xenografted SPECIES_10090_nude_mice; and revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in autophagic- and apoptotic-cell death.
28219700	Treatment of MDA-MB-231  cells with fermented culture broth of AS (0-200   g/mL) inhibited cell viability/growth.
28219700	AS-induced autophagy was evidenced via increased LC3-II accumulation, GFP-LC3 puncta and CHEMICAL__AVOs formation in MDA-MB-231  cells.
28219700	These events are associated with increased GENE_10533_ATG7, decreased p-GENE_2475_mTOR, vanished GENE_8878_SQSTM1/GENE_8878_p62 expressions and dysregulated GENE_8678_Beclin_1/GENE_596_Bcl_2 ratio.
28219700	AS-induced apoptosis/DISEASE_D009336_necrosis through increased DNA fragmentation, GENE_308_Annexin_V/PI stained cells and GENE_581_Bax expression.
28219700	Both mitochondrial (GENE_842_caspase_9/GENE_836_caspase_3/GENE_1302_PARP) and death-receptor (GENE_841_caspase_8/GENE_356_FasL/Fas) signaling pathways are involved in execution of apoptosis.
28219700	Interestingly, blockade of AS-induced ROS production by CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine pretreatment substantially attenuated AS-induced autophagy, DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction and autophagic/apoptotic-cell death.
28219700	Inhibition of apoptosis by CHEMICAL__Z_VAD_FMK suppressed AS-induced DISEASE_D003643_autophagic_death (decreased LC3-II/AVOs).
28219700	Similarly, inhibition of autophagy by CHEMICAL_C025946_3_methyladenine/CHEMICAL_D002738_chloroquine diminished AS-induced apoptosis (decreased DNA fragmentation/GENE_836_caspase_3) in MDA-MB-231  cells.
28219700	Bioluminescence imaging further confirmed that AS inhibited DISEASE_D001943_breast_tumor growth in living MDA-MB-231-luciferase-injected SPECIES_10090_nude_mice.
28219700	Taken together, AS crucially involved in execution/propagation of autophagic- or apoptotic-death of MDA-MB-231  cells, and decreased DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth in xenografted SPECIES_10090_nude_mice.
28225195	Protective effect of CHEMICAL_C005975_hydroxytyrosol in CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SPECIES_10116_rat brain.
28225195	The present study was planned to investigate the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C005975_hydroxytyrosol (HT) against CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic (As)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SPECIES_10116_rat brain.
28225195	SPECIES_10116_Rats exposed to CHEMICAL_C017947_sodium_arsenite (25  ppm for 8 weeks) showed decreased mitochondrial complexes (I, II, IV) activities, GENE_10116)_mitochondrial_superoxide_dismutase (GENE_10116)_MnSOD), and catalase activities in brain mitochondria.
28225195	As-treated SPECIES_10116_rats showed reduced mRNA expression of GENE_10116)_complex_I_ND_1, ND-2), IV (GENE_10116)_COX_1, GENE_10116)_COX_4) subunits, and GENE_10116)_uncoupling_protein_2 (GENE_10116)_UCP_2).
28225195	In addition to this, As exposure downregulated the protein expression of GENE_10116)_MnSOD.
28225195	Administration of HT with As restored the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial complexes, GENE_10116)_MnSOD and catalase, increased the mRNA levels of complexes subunits and GENE_10116)_UCP_2 as well as proteins level of GENE_10116)_MnSOD.
28225195	These results suggest that HT efficiently restores mitochondrial dysfunction in As neurotoxicity and might be used as potential mitoprotective agent in future.
28229933	Nuclear lamins and progerin are dispensable for antioxidant GENE_4780_Nrf2 response to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium.
28229933	CHEMICAL__Lamins are important constituents of the nuclear inner membrane and provide a platform for transcription factors and chromatin.
28229933	Progerin, a CHEMICAL__C-terminal truncated lamin A mutant, causes DISEASE_D019588_premature_aging termed DISEASE_D011371_Hutchinson_Gilford_Progeria_Syndrome (DISEASE_D011371_HGPS).
28229933	Oxidative stress appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D011371_HGPS, although the mechanistic role of progerin remains elusive.
28229933	Here we examined whether nuclear lamins are important for a cellular antioxidant mechanism, and whether progerin compromises it.
28229933	We investigated the activation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (GENE_4780_Nrf2) which regulates various antioxidant genes including GENE_3162_heme_oxygenase_1 (GENE_3162_HMOX1), following exposure to CHEMICAL_C017947_sodium_arsenite or CHEMICAL_D019256_cadmium_chloride in lamin knockdown SPECIES_9606_human cell lines and primary DISEASE_D011371_HGPS SPECIES_9606_human fibroblasts.
28229933	Knocking down lamin A/C, or B, or all nuclear lamins simultaneously in three SPECIES_9606_human cell lines (HaCaT, SW480, and K562) did not impair CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite- or CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-induced activation of GENE_4780_Nrf2.
28229933	Progerin-expressing SPECIES_9606_human primary DISEASE_D011371_HGPS fibroblasts showed lower basal levels of GENE_3162_HMOX1 and GENE_1728_NQO1 expression; however, in response to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic stress both normal and DISEASE_D011371_HGPS primary fibroblasts showed GENE_4780_Nrf2 nuclear accumulation along with upregulation and phosphorylation of GENE_8878_p62/GENE_8878_SQSTM1 at Ser351, downregulation of GENE_9817_Keap1, and comparable expression of an array of downstream GENE_4780_Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes.
28229933	We also observed new forms of cleaved lamin A, B1 and B2 induced by CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium stress although their roles in the GENE_4780_Nrf2 antioxidant system need further investigation.
28229933	These results suggest that the nuclear lamins and progerin have marginal roles in the activation of the antioxidant GENE_4780_Nrf2 response to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium.
28235547	Intermittent hypercapnic DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia effects on the nicotinic CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine receptors in the developing piglet hippocampus and brainstem.
28235547	This study investigated the effects of acute (1 day) vs repeated (4 days) exposure to DISEASE_D000860_intermittent_hypercapnic_hypoxia (DISEASE_D000860_IHH) on the immunohistochemical expression of a2, a3, a5, a7, a9 and b2 nicotinic CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine receptor (GENE_1137_nAChR) subunits in the developing piglet hippocampus and brainstem medulla, and how prior CHEMICAL_D009538_nicotine exposure alters the response to acute DISEASE_D000860_IHH.
28235547	Five piglet groups included: 1day DISEASE_D000860_IHH (1D DISEASE_D000860_IHH, n=9), 4days DISEASE_D000860_IHH (4D DISEASE_D000860_IHH, n=8), controls exposed only to air cycles for 1day (1D Air, n=6) or 4days (4D Air, n=5), and pre-exposed to CHEMICAL_D009538_nicotine for 13days prior to 1day DISEASE_D000860_IHH (Nic+1D DISEASE_D000860_IHH, n=7).
28235547	The exposure period alternated 6min of HH (8%O2, CHEMICAL__7_CO2, balance N2) and 6min of air over 48min, while controls were switched from air-to-air.
28235547	Results showed that: 1. repeated DISEASE_D000860_IHH induces more changes in GENE_1137_nAChR subunit expression than acute DISEASE_D000860_IHH in both the hippocampus and brainstem medulla, 2.
28235547	In the hippocampus, a2 and b2 changed the most (increased) following DISEASE_D000860_IHH and the GENE_761_CA3, GENE_760_CA2 and DG were mostly affected.
28235547	In the brainstem medulla, a2, a5, a9 and b2 were changed (decreased) in most nuclei with the hypoglossal and nucleus of the solitary tract being mostly affected.
28235547	3.
28235547	Pre-exposure to CHEMICAL_D009538_nicotine enhanced the changes in the hippocampus but dampened those in the brainstem medulla.
28235547	These findings indicate that the nAChRs (predominantly with the a2/b2 complex) are affected by DISEASE_D000860_IHH in critical hippocampal and brainstem nuclei during early brain development, and that pre-exposure to CHEMICAL_D009538_nicotine alters the pattern of susceptibility to DISEASE_D000860_IHH.
28235426	Antiproliferative activity and apoptosis induction by CHEMICAL__3_4_dibenzyloxyflavonol on SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells.
28235426	In this study, we investigated the effects of synthetic CHEMICAL__3_4_dibenzyloxyflavonol on viabilities of eight SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells.
28235426	It was cytotoxic against DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells (HL-60, U-937, MOLT-3, K-562, NALM-6, Raji), with significant effects against P-glycoprotein-overexpressing K-562/ADR and GENE_596_Bcl_2-overexpressing U-937/GENE_596_Bcl_2  cells, but had no significant cytotoxic effects against quiescent or proliferating SPECIES_9606_human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
28235426	The IC50 value for the DISEASE_D007938_leukemia HL-60  cells was 0.8      0.1   M. This indicates a 60-fold greater DISEASE_D064420_toxicity than the naturally occurring flavonol CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin.
28235426	Synthetic CHEMICAL__3_4_dibenzyloxyflavonol induced S phase cell cycle arrest and was a potent apoptotic inducer in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells.
28235426	Cell death was (i) mediated by the activation and the cleavage of initiator and executioner caspases; (ii) prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor CHEMICAL__z_VAD_fmk; (iii) associated with the release of GENE_54205_cytochrome_c and with the phosphorylation of members of the mitogen activated protein kinases including GENE_1432_p38(MAPK), GENE_5599;5601_JNK_SAPK and ERK, and (iv) independent of the generation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species.
28235426	The synthetic CHEMICAL__3_4_dibenzyloxyflavonol is a potent cytotoxic compound against several SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cells and might be useful in the development of new strategies in the fight against DISEASE_D009369_cancer.
28235592	CHEMICAL_D013256_Steroid profiling in H295R cells to identify chemicals potentially disrupting the production of adrenal CHEMICAL_D013256_steroids.
28235592	The validated OECD test guideline 456 based on SPECIES_9606_human adrenal H295R cells promotes measurement of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone and CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol production as read-out to identify potential endocrine disrupting chemicals.
28235592	This study aimed to establish optimal conditions for using H295R cells to detect chemicals interfering with the production of key adrenal CHEMICAL_D013256_steroids.
28235592	H295R cells' supernatants were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid profiling, and the influence of experimental conditions including time and serum content was assessed.
28235592	CHEMICAL_D013256_Steroid profiles were determined before and after incubation with reference compounds and chemicals to be tested for potential disruption of adrenal steroidogenesis.
28235592	The H295R cells cultivated according to the OECD test guideline produced CHEMICAL_D011372_progestins, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and adrenal CHEMICAL_D000728_androgens but only very low amounts of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone.
28235592	However, CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone contained in Nu-serum was metabolized during the 48h incubation.
28235592	Thus, inclusion of positive and negative controls and a CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid profile of the complete medium prior to the experiment (t=0h) was necessary to characterize H295R cells' CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid production and indicate alterations caused by exposure to chemicals.
28235592	Among the tested chemicals, CHEMICAL_C118580_octyl_methoxycinnamate and CHEMICAL_C014953_acetyl_tributylcitrate resembled the corticosteroid induction pattern of the positive control CHEMICAL_C483909_torcetrapib.
28235592	Gene expression analysis revealed that CHEMICAL_C118580_octyl_methoxycinnamate and CHEMICAL_C014953_acetyl_tributylcitrate enhanced GENE_1585_CYP11B2 expression, although less pronounced than torcetrapib.
28235592	Further experiments need to assess the toxicological relevance of CHEMICAL_C118580_octyl_methoxycinnamate- and CHEMICAL_C014953_acetyl_tributylcitrate-induced corticosteroid production.
28235592	In conclusion, the extended profiling and appropriate controls allow detecting chemicals that act on steroidogenesis and provide initial mechanistic evidence for prioritizing chemicals for further investigations.
28235804	CHEMICAL_D009569_Nitric_oxide synthase trafficking inducer is a pleiotropic regulator of endothelial cell function and signaling.
28235804	GENE_4846_Endothelial_nitric_oxide_synthase (eNOS) and its bioactive product, CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO), mediate many endothelial cell functions, including angiogenesis and vascular permeability.
28235804	For example, GENE_7422_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor (GENE_7422_VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis is inhibited upon reduction of NO bioactivity both in vitro and in vivo Moreover, genetic disruption or pharmacological inhibition of eNOS attenuates angiogenesis during tissue repair, resulting in delayed wound closure.
28235804	These observations emphasize that eNOS-derived NO can promote angiogenesis.
28235804	Intriguingly, eNOS activity is regulated by CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide synthase trafficking inducer (GENE_115677_NOSTRIN), which sequesters eNOS, thereby attenuating NO production.
28235804	This has prompted significant interest in GENE_115677_NOSTRIN's function in endothelial cells.
28235804	We show here that GENE_115677_NOSTRIN affects the functional transcriptome of endothelial cells by down-regulating several genes important for invasion and angiogenesis.
28235804	Interestingly, the effects of GENE_115677_NOSTRIN on endothelial gene expression were independent of eNOS activity.
28235804	GENE_115677_NOSTRIN also affected the expression of secreted cytokines involved in inflammatory responses, and ectopic GENE_115677_NOSTRIN overexpression functionally restricted endothelial cell proliferation, invasion, adhesion, and GENE_7422_VEGF-induced capillary tube formation.
28235804	Furthermore, GENE_115677_NOSTRIN interacted directly with GENE_222344_TNF_receptor_associated_factor_6 (GENE_222344_TRAF6), leading to the suppression of NFkB activity and inhibition of AKT activation via phosphorylation.
28235804	Interestingly, GENE_7124_TNF_a-induced NFkB pathway activation was reversed by GENE_115677_NOSTRIN.
28235804	We found that the SH3 domain of GENE_115677_NOSTRIN is involved in the GENE_115677_NOSTRIN-GENE_222344_TRAF6 interaction and is required for GENE_115677_NOSTRIN-induced down-regulation of endothelial cell proteins.
28235804	These results have broad biological implications, as aberrant GENE_115677_NOSTRIN expression leading to deactivation of the NFkB pathway, in turn triggering an anti-angiogenic cascade, might inhibit tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
28238261	Lipidomic Evaluation of CHEMICAL__Aryl_Hydrocarbon Receptor-Mediated DISEASE_D005234_Hepatic_Steatosis in SPECIES_9606_Male and Female SPECIES_10090_Mice Elicited by CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_Tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin.
28238261	The environmental contaminant CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) induces DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis mediated by the CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor.
28238261	To further characterize CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-elicited hepatic lipid accumulation, SPECIES_10090_mice were gavaged with CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD every 4 days for 28 days.
28238261	Liver samples were examined using untargeted lipidomics with structural confirmation of lipid species by targeted high-resolution MS/MS, and data were integrated with complementary RNA-Seq analyses.
28238261	Approximately 936 unique spectral features were detected, of which 379 were confirmed as unique lipid species.
28238261	Both SPECIES_9606_male and female samples exhibited similar qualitative changes (lipid species) but differed in quantitative changes.
28238261	A shift to higher mass lipid species was observed, indicative of increased free CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid (FFA) packaging.
28238261	For example, of the 13 lipid classes examined, CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides increased from 46 to 48% of total lipids to 68-83% in CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD treated animals.
28238261	Hepatic CHEMICAL_D002788_cholesterol_esters increased 11.3-fold in SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice with moieties consisting largely of dietary CHEMICAL_D005227_fatty_acids (CHEMICAL__FAs) (i.e., CHEMICAL_D017962_linolenate, CHEMICAL_7896_palmitate, and CHEMICAL_D019301_oleate).
28238261	CHEMICAL_D010718_Phosphatidylserines, CHEMICAL_D010714_phosphatidylethanolamines, CHEMICAL_D010712_phosphatidic_acids, and CHEMICAL_D002308_cardiolipins decreased 4.1-, 5.0-, 5.4- and 7.4-fold, respectively, while CHEMICAL_D002518_ceramides increased 6.6-fold.
28238261	Accordingly, the integration of lipidomic data with differential gene expression associated with lipid metabolism suggests that in addition to the repression of de novo CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid synthesis and b-oxidation, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD also increased hepatic uptake and packaging of lipids, while inhibiting VLDL secretion, consistent with hepatic fat accumulation and the progression to DISEASE_D005234_steatohepatitis with DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28238728	An integrative transcriptomic analysis reveals CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A exposure-induced dysregulation of microRNA expression in SPECIES_9606_human endometrial cells.
28238728	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) are commonly used in the manufacture of CHEMICAL_61433_polycarbonate plastics.
28238728	Higher CHEMICAL__BPA exposure levels have been found in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D004714_endometrial_hyperplasia that is one of risk factors of DISEASE_D016889_endometrial_cancer (DISEASE_D016889_EC).
28238728	Aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation has been observed in the development of DISEASE_D009369_cancer.
28238728	Thus, this study investigated whether CHEMICAL__BPA exposure can disrupt miRNA regulation and its gene expression regarding to DISEASE_D016889_EC carcinogenic progress.
28238728	Microarray experiments of miRNA and mRNA were performed in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D016889_endometrial_cancer SPECIES_9606_RL95_2 cells with treatment of low-to-moderate (10, 10<sup>3</sup>and 10<sup>5</sup>nM) CHEMICAL__BPA to explore the aberrant genes corresponding to SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D016889_EC progression.
28238728	According to the analysis of KEGG pathway and Cytoscape gene network, this study identified that CHEMICAL__BPA exposure reduced GENE_406941_miR_149 expression to down-regulate DNA repair gene GENE_382_ARF6 (CHEMICAL_D000244_ADP-ribosylation factor 6) and DISEASE_D009369_tumor protein GENE_7157_p53 (GENE_7157_TP53), and up-regulate GENE_9134_CCNE2 (GENE_9134_cyclin_E2) potentially to interrupt cell cycle.
28238728	CHEMICAL__BPA also increased GENE_406901_miR_107 to suppress hedgehog signaling factors, GENE_51684_suppressor_of_fused_homolog (GENE_51684_SUFU) and GENE_2737_GLI_family_zinc_finger_3 (GENE_2737_GLI3) to activate hedgehog signaling for cell proliferation underlying DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28238728	Furthermore, the CHEMICAL__BPA-induced cell proliferation was attenuated by transfection with GENE_406941_miR_149 mimic and GENE_406901_miR_107 inhibitor.
28238728	These findings provided an insight into potential epigenetic mechanism of CHEMICAL__BPA exposure on the risk of endometrial DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28238930	The acute exposure of CHEMICAL_36703_tetrachloro_p_benzoquinone (a.k.a.
28238930	CHEMICAL_D002703_chloranil) triggers DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and DISEASE_D009461_neurological_dysfunction via GENE_7099_Toll_like_receptor_4 signaling: The protective role of CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin preconditioning.
28238930	This study is aimed to investigate the DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and DISEASE_D009461_neurological_dysfunction induced by CHEMICAL_36703_tetrachloro_p_benzoquinone (CHEMICAL__TCBQ) through GENE_7099_Toll_like_receptor_4 (GENE_7099_TLR4) signaling.
28238930	We also investigated the protective role of CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.
28238930	In vitro model was established by SPECIES_10116_rat DISEASE_D010673_pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, meanwhile, GENE_10116)_TLR4 wild-type (SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6) and knockout SPECIES_10090_mice (C57BL/10ScNJ GENE_10090)_TLR4-/-) were used as in vivo model.
28238930	In vitro study showed CHEMICAL__TCBQ exposure enhanced the expression of GENE_7099_TLR4, GENE_4615_myeloid_differentiation_factor_88 (GENE_4615_MyD88) at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
28238930	By contrast, CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin decreased GENE_7099_TLR4 and GENE_4615_MyD88 expressions.
28238930	Moreover, our result indicated that CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin disrupted the formation of GENE_7099_TLR4/GENE_4615_MyD88/GENE_23643_MD2/GENE_929_CD14 complex.
28238930	In addition, CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin terminated CHEMICAL__TCBQ-mediated phosphorylation of GENE_5599_c_Jun_N_terminal_kinase (GENE_5599_JNK), GENE_1432_p38, and GENE_5594_extracellular_regulated_protein_kinase (GENE_5594_ERK) signaling and hampered its downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine releases.
28238930	In vivo result also indicated DISEASE_D046150_TLR4_deficiency partially protected against CHEMICAL__TCBQ-induced morphological and neuropathological changes in SPECIES_10090_mice brain, suggested the role of GENE_10090)_TLR4.
28238930	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin modulates CHEMICAL__TCBQ-mediated inflammatory genes through GENE_7099_TLR4/GENE_4615_MyD88-dependent signaling pathway.
28238930	Our current study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first time show CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin not only disrupt the binding of GENE_7099_TLR4 and GENE_4615_MyD88, but also restricted the formation of GENE_7099_TLR4/GENE_23643_MD2/GENE_929_CD14 complex, suggesting that CHEMICAL_D008550_melatonin supplementary may represent a valuable therapeutic strategy for inflammatory DISEASE_D009461_neurological_dysfunction.
28242239	Role of GENE_7099_Toll_like_receptor_4 in drug-drug interaction between CHEMICAL_D017239_paclitaxel and CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan in vitro.
28242239	The SPECIES_2_bacterial receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 mediates inflammatory responses and has been linked to a broad array of diseases.
28242239	GENE_7099_TLR4 agonists are being explored as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.
28242239	We have previously shown that activation of GENE_7099_TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to down-regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes/transporters (DMETs), and altered pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of drugs.
28242239	These changes can increase the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in SPECIES_9606_patients on multiple medications.
28242239	Clinically, DDI was observed for combination chemotherapy of CHEMICAL_D017239_paclitaxel (GENE_7099_TLR4 ligand) and CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan.
28242239	To determine the role of GENE_10090)_TLR4 in DDI between CHEMICAL_D017239_paclitaxel and CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan in vitro, primary hepatocytes from GENE_10090)_TLR4-wild-type (WT) and mutant SPECIES_10090_mice were pre-treated with CHEMICAL_D017239_paclitaxel, followed by CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan.
28242239	Gene expression of DMETs was determined.
28242239	CHEMICAL_D017239_Paclitaxel treatment increased the levels of CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan metabolites, CHEMICAL_C051890_SN_38 and CHEMICAL_C051890_SN_38 glucuronide (SN-38G) in GENE_7099_TLR4-dependent manner.
28242239	CHEMICAL_D017239_Paclitaxel-mediated induction of genes involved in CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan metabolism such as Cyp3a11 and GENE_54658_Ugt1a1 was GENE_7099_TLR4-dependent, while induction of the transporter GENE_1244_Mrp2 was GENE_7099_TLR4-independent.
28242239	These novel findings demonstrate that CHEMICAL_D017239_paclitaxel can affect CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan metabolism by a GENE_7099_TLR4-dependent mechanism.
28242239	This provides a new perspective towards evaluation of marketed drugs according to their potential to exert DDIs in GENE_7099_TLR4-dependent manner.
28242381	Antidiabetic effect of CHEMICAL__SN158 through GENE_10090)_PPARa/y dual activation in ob/ob SPECIES_10090_mice.
28242381	In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the antidiabetic potential of CHEMICAL___E_N_4_3_5_bromo_4_hydroxy_2_methoxyphenyl_acryloyl_phenyl_4_tert_butylbenzamide (CHEMICAL__SN158) through GENE_10090)_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor (GENE_10090)_PPAR)-a/y dual activation.
28242381	CHEMICAL__SN158 interacted with both GENE_10090)_PPARa and PPARy, and increased their transcriptional activities.
28242381	Simultaneously, CHEMICAL__SN158 treatment led to an increase in adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid oxidation in hepatocytes.
28242381	In addition, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake in myotubes was significantly increased by CHEMICAL__SN158 treatment.
28242381	Finally, CHEMICAL__SN158 significantly lowered the plasma levels of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides, and CHEMICAL_D005230_free_fatty_acids in ob/ob SPECIES_10090_mice without severe DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain and DISEASE_D006529_hepatomegaly.
28242381	These results suggest that CHEMICAL__SN158 can be useful as a potential therapeutic agent against type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes and related DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disorders by alleviating CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and DISEASE_C562935_lipid_abnormalities.
28242765	A novel role for the Wnt inhibitor GENE_10090)_APCDD1 in adipocyte differentiation: Implications for diet-induced DISEASE_D009765_obesity.
28242765	Impaired adipogenic differentiation during diet-induced DISEASE_D009765_obesity (SPECIES_10090_DIO) promotes adipocyte DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, thereby contributing to DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disease.
28242765	DISEASE_D011125_Adenomatosis_polyposis_coli down-regulated 1 (GENE_10090)_APCDD1) has recently been identified as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, a key regulator of adipogenic differentiation.
28242765	Here we report a novel role for GENE_10090)_APCDD1 in adipogenic differentiation via repression of Wnt signaling and an epigenetic linkage between miR-130 and GENE_10090)_APCDD1 in SPECIES_10090_DIO.
28242765	GENE_147495_APCDD1 expression was significantly up-regulated in mature adipocytes compared with undifferentiated preadipocytes in both SPECIES_9606_human and SPECIES_10090_mouse subcutaneous adipose tissues.
28242765	siRNA-based silencing of GENE_10090)_APCDD1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes markedly increased the expression of Wnt signaling proteins (GENE_10090)_Wnt3a, GENE_10090)_Wnt5a, GENE_10090)_Wnt10b, GENE_10090)_LRP5, and b-catenin) and inhibited the expression of adipocyte differentiation markers (GENE_10090)_CCAAT_enhancer_binding_protein_a (GENE_10090)_C_EBPa) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (GENE_5468_PPARy)) and lipid droplet accumulation, whereas SPECIES_10535_adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GENE_10090)_APCDD1 enhanced adipogenic differentiation.
28242765	Notably, SPECIES_10090_DIO SPECIES_10090_mice exhibited reduced GENE_10090)_APCDD1 expression and increased Wnt expression in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues and impaired adipogenic differentiation <i>in vitro</i> Mechanistically, we found that miR-130, whose expression is up-regulated in adipose tissues of SPECIES_10090_DIO SPECIES_10090_mice, could directly target the 3'-untranslated region of the GENE_10090)_APCDD1 gene.
28242765	Furthermore, transfection of an miR-130 inhibitor in preadipocytes enhanced, whereas an miR-130 mimic blunted, adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that miR-130 contributes to impaired adipogenic differentiation during SPECIES_10090_DIO by repressing GENE_10090)_APCDD1 expression.
28242765	Finally, SPECIES_9606_human subcutaneous adipose tissues isolated from obese individuals exhibited reduced expression of GENE_147495_APCDD1, GENE_1050_C_EBPa, and GENE_5468_PPARy compared with those from non-obese subjects.
28242765	Taken together, these novel findings suggest that GENE_10090)_APCDD1 positively regulates adipogenic differentiation and that its down-regulation by miR-130 during SPECIES_10090_DIO may contribute to impaired adipogenic differentiation and DISEASE_D009765_obesity-related DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disease.
28237621	Inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic inhibits the CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair pathway and reduces the expression of GENE_7508_XPC.
28237621	Chronic exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic, most often through contaminated drinking water, has been linked to several types of DISEASE_D009369_cancer in SPECIES_9606_humans, including DISEASE_D008175_skin_and_lung_cancer.
28237621	However, the mechanisms underlying its role in causing DISEASE_D009369_cancer are not well understood.
28237621	There is evidence that exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic can enhance the carcinogenicity of UV light in inducing DISEASE_D012878_skin_cancers and may enhance the DISEASE_D014029_carcinogenicity_of_tobacco_smoke in inducing DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancers.
28237621	The CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway removes different types of DNA damage including those produced by UV light and components of SPECIES_4097_tobacco smoke.
28237621	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of CHEMICAL_C017947_sodium_arsenite on the NER pathway in SPECIES_9606_human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90 cells) and primary SPECIES_10090_mouse keratinocytes.
28237621	To measure NER, we employed a slot-blot assay to quantify the introduction and removal of UV light-induced 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP) and CHEMICAL_D011740_cyclobutane_pyrimidine_dimers (CHEMICAL__CPDs).
28237621	We find a concentration-dependent inhibition of the removal of 6-4 PPs and CHEMICAL__CPDs in both cell types treated with CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28237621	Treatment of both cell types with CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite resulted in a significant reduction in the abundance of GENE_7508_XPC, a protein that is critical for DNA damage recognition in NER.
28237621	The abundance of RNA expressed from several key NER genes was also significantly reduced by treatment of IMR-90 cells with CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28237621	Finally, treatment of IMR-90 cells with CHEMICAL_C072553_MG_132 abrogated the reduction in GENE_7508_XPC protein, suggesting an involvement of the proteasome in the reduction of GENE_7508_XPC protein produced by treatment of cells with CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic.
28237621	The inhibition of NER by CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic may reflect one mechanism underlying the role of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure in enhancing cigarette smoke-induced DISEASE_D063646_lung_carcinogenesis and UV light-induced DISEASE_D012878_skin_cancer, and it may provide some insights into the emergence of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide as a chemotherapeutic agent.
28237877	CHEMICAL__Osimertinib induces autophagy and apoptosis via reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species generation in DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer cells.
28237877	CHEMICAL__Osimertinib (CHEMICAL_30589_OSI), also known as CHEMICAL_C000596361_AZD9291, is a third-generation GENE_1956_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR) CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer (DISEASE_D002289_NSCLC) SPECIES_9606_patients harboring GENE_1956_EGFR PROTEINMUTATION_121434569_T790M mutation.
28237877	Herein, we indicated for the first time that CHEMICAL_30589_OSI increased the accumulations of cytoplasmic vacuoles, the expression of CHEMICAL_C483858_phosphatidylethanolamine-modified microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3-II), and the formation of GFP-LC3 puncta in various DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells.
28237877	The CHEMICAL_30589_OSI-induced expression of LC3-II was further increased when combined treatment with CHEMICAL_D002738_chloroquine (CHEMICAL__CQ), an autophagy inhibitor, and the mRFP-EGFP-LC3 plasmid-transfected cells exposed to CHEMICAL_30589_OSI led to the production of more red-fluorescent puncta than green-fluorescent puncta, indicating CHEMICAL_30589_OSI induced autophagic flux in the DISEASE_D002289_NSCLC cells.
28237877	Knockdown of GENE_1956_EGFR showed no effect on the CHEMICAL_30589_OSI-induced expression of LC3-II in SPECIES_9606_NCI_H1975 cells.
28237877	In addition, CHEMICAL_30589_OSI increased reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenge of ROS via pretreatment with CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine (GENE_7504_NAC), GENE_847_catalase (CAT), or CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E (CHEMICAL_D024505_Vita_E) significantly inhibited CHEMICAL_30589_OSI-induced the accumulations of cytoplasmic vacuoles, the expression of LC3-II, as well as the formation of GFP-LC3 puncta.
28237877	Combinative treatment with CHEMICAL__CQ could not remarkably change the CHEMICAL_30589_OSI-induced cell viability decrease, whereas the CHEMICAL_30589_OSI-induced cell viability decrease and apoptosis could be reversed through pretreatment with GENE_7504_NAC, CAT, and CHEMICAL_D024505_Vita_E, respectively.
28237877	Taken together, this is the first report that CHEMICAL_30589_OSI induces an accompanied autophagy and the generation of ROS is critical for the CHEMICAL_30589_OSI-induced autophagy, cell viability decrease, and apoptosis in DISEASE_D002289_NSCLC cells.
28242320	A positive feedback loop between CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide and amyloid b (1-42) accelerates DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage in DISEASE_D007905_human_lens_epithelial cells.
28242320	We have reported that excessive CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO), like other reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS), causes a decrease in cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity and CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP levels (DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage) resulting in DISEASE_D002386_lens_opacity.
28242320	In addition, previous reports have shown that oxidative stress caused by ROS enhances amyloid b (Ab) production in SPECIES_9606_mammalian lenses, and that Ab1-42 stimulates inducible CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide synthase (GENE_4843_iNOS) promoter activity.
28242320	Based on these reports, we investigated the relationship between NO and Ab1-42 production in DISEASE_D007905_human_lens_epithelial (DISEASE_D007905_HLE) cells.
28242320	GENE_4843_iNOS was induced by the co-incubation of DISEASE_D007905_HLE cells with 1000 IU interferon-y (IFN-y) and 100ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 48h.
28242320	This led to enhanced NO release, an increase in the gene expression levels of proteins related to Ab production, and the cellular accumulation of Ab1-42.
28242320	Moreover, both CHEMICAL_C004479_aminoguanidine (CHEMICAL__AG, a selective inhibitor of GENE_4843_iNOS) and CHEMICAL_D004050_diethyldithiocarbamate (CHEMICAL_10101_DDC, a nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) inhibitor) attenuated these changes in IFN-y and LPS stimulated DISEASE_D007905_HLE cells.
28242320	Based on our finding that Ab1-42 accumulation is induced by co-incubation of DISEASE_D007905_HLE cells with both IFN-y and LPS, we prepared a DISEASE_D007905_HLE cell model with Ab1-42 accumulation (Ab-accumulated-DISEASE_D007905_HLE cell model) by pre-stimulating cells with IFN-y and LPS for 48h.
28242320	Ab1-42 accumulation caused NO production via GENE_4843_iNOS, resulting in an enhancement in the mRNA levels for enzymes necessary for the proteolysis of GENE_351_amyloid_precursor_protein (GENE_351_APP) to Ab in DISEASE_D007905_HLE cells.
28242320	In addition, excessive NO produced in response to Ab1-42 accumulation led to a decrease in CCO activity and CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP levels.
28242320	Taken together, we hypothesize that excessive NO production in the lens epithelium enhances Ab1-42 production, and that this enhancement accelerates NO release.
28242320	The enhancement in NO production in the lens epithelium based on positive feedback (CHEMICAL__NO_Ab positive feedback loop, a vicious cycle) may promote the onset of DISEASE_D002386_cataracts (lens opacification) via the decrease in CCO activity and CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP levels.
28242320	These findings provide significant information that can be used to design further studies aimed at developing anti-DISEASE_D002386_cataract drugs.
28245982	Comparative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles in cells and exosomes under CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene exposure.
28245982	Recent studies have illustrated the growing importance of exosomes (small extracellular vesicles) and their constituent microRNAs (miRNAs) in the fields of toxicology and pathology.
28245982	The mechanism of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene, a highly-prevalent and volatile organic compound, is largely unknown.
28245982	To examine the role of miRNAs in CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity, we investigated miRNAs and CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene-induced gene expression in HL-60 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D015473_promyelocytic_leukemia cells and exosomes using microarrays.
28245982	A total of 54 miRNAs were differentially expressed in HL-60 cell lines exposed to CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene and exosomes from the cells.
28245982	Four out of the 54 miRNAs (GENE_100302276_hsa_miR_1290, GENE_100313781_hsa_miR_718, GENE_100500893_hsa_miR_3663-3p, and hsa-miR-320c) were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR.
28245982	Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles identified 8 miRNA-mRNA correlations.
28245982	By performing Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis, we found that the eight putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs under CHEMICAL_D014050_toluene exposure (GENE_118460_EXOSC6, GENE_399_RHOH, GENE_2671_GFER, GENE_8924_HERC2, GENE_2803_GOLGA4, GENE_23657_SLC7A11, GENE_2730_GCLM, and GENE_571_BACH1) are related to diverse disease categories such as DISEASE_D009422_nervous_system_disease, DISEASE_D009369_cancer, DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease, and DISEASE_D012140_respiratory_tract_disease.
28245982	In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miRNA-mRNA networks provide a better understanding of toxicological mechanism caused by environmental pollutants in vitro using HL-60 cells and exosomes.
28245985	CHEMICAL_C121358_4_PBA inhibits LPS-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation through regulating ER stress and autophagy in DISEASE_D055371_acute_lung_injury models.
28245985	DISEASE_D055371_Acute_lung_injury (DISEASE_D055371_ALI) is a common clinical disorder that causes substantial health problems worldwide.
28245985	An excessive inflammatory response is the central feature of DISEASE_D055371_ALI, but the mechanism is still unclear, especially the role of endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy.
28245985	To identify the cellular mechanism of DISEASE_D011014_lung_inflammation during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SPECIES_10090_mouse model of DISEASE_D055371_ALI, we investigated the influence of classic ER stress inhibitor CHEMICAL_C075773_4_phenyl_butyric_acid (CHEMICAL_C121358_4_PBA) on ER stress and autophagy, which partially affect the activation of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, both in LPS-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI_mouse model and SPECIES_9606_human alveolar epithelial cell model.
28245985	We demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C121358_4_PBA, which further prevented the activation of the NF-kB pathway, decreased the release of the pro-inflammatory mediators GENE_3553_IL_1b, GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3569_IL_6, significantly inhibited LPS-activated ER stress.
28245985	Moreover, it was found that autophagy was also decreased by the treatment of CHEMICAL_C121358_4_PBA, which may play a protective role in DISEASE_D055371_ALI models through the classical AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
28245985	Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA exacerbates DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity induced by LPS in A549 alveolar epithelial cells.
28245985	Taken together, our study indicated that ER stress is a key promoter in the induction of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation by LPS, the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C121358_4_PBA is related to the inhibition of ER stress and autophagy in LPS-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI models.
28245985	Furthermore, the role of autophagy that contributes to cell survival may depend on the activation of ER stress.
28245986	GENE_11315_DJ_1 regulating PI3K-GENE_4780_Nrf2 signaling plays a significant role in CHEMICAL_34047_bibenzyl compound 20C-mediated neuroprotection against CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced oxidative insult.
28245986	DISEASE_D004194_Oxidative_stress is thought to be involved in the development of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD).
28245986	We previously reported that 20C, a CHEMICAL_34047_bibenzyl compound isolated from Gastrodia elata, possesses antioxidative properties, but its in-depth molecular mechanisms against CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity remains unknown.
28245986	Recent studies indicate that without intact GENE_11315_DJ_1_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor (GENE_4780_Nrf2) protein becomes unstable, and the activity of GENE_4780_Nrf2-mediated downstream antioxidant enzymes are thereby suppressed.
28245986	In this study, we showed that 20C clearly protected PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells against CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced oxidative injury.
28245986	Furthermore, 20C markedly up-regulated the levels of GENE_11315_DJ_1, which in turn activated CHEMICAL_18179_phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling and inhibited GENE_2932_glycogen_synthase_kinase_3b (GENE_2932_GSK3b) activation, eventually promoted the nuclear translocation of GENE_4780_Nrf2 and induced the expression of GENE_3162_hemeoxygenase_1 (HO-1).
28245986	The antioxidant effects of 20C could be partially blocked by ShRNA-mediated knockdown of GENE_11315_DJ_1 and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathways with Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor, respectively.
28245986	Conclusively, our findings confirm that GENE_11315_DJ_1 is necessary for 20C-mediated protection against CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced oxidative damage, at least in part, by activating PI3K/Akt signaling, and subsequently enhancing the nuclear accumulation of GENE_4780_Nrf2.
28245986	The findings from our investigation suggest that 20C should be developed as a novel candidate for alleviating the consequences of DISEASE_D010300_PD in the future.
28249226	Molecular effectors in the chronic exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic as early and sensitive biomarkers in developing Rhinella arenarum toads.
28249226	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic, a natural element of ecological relevance, is one of the most toxic elements present in various regions of the world.
28249226	It can be found in natural water sources throughout Argentina in concentrations between 0.01 and 15mgL(-1).
28249226	The Argentinean autochthonous toad Rhinella arenarum was selected to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects and response to the chronic As exposure along its embryonic and larval development.
28249226	We evaluated the effects on MAPK signal transduction pathway and transcription factors GENE_2353_c_FOS and GENE_3725_c_JUN, and the regulation of the expression at protein levels of different antioxidant enzymes.
28249226	Our results indicated that As is modulating the MAPK pathway, increasing GENE_5609_MEK and GENE_5594_ERK levels both in the nuclear and post-nuclear fraction along the embryonic development and mainly at the beginning of the larval stage.
28249226	Through this pathway, As can upregulate transcription factors like GENE_2353_c_FOS and GENE_3725_c_JUN, impacting the antioxidant response of the exposed embryos and larvae through antioxidant enzymes and recycling of CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH.
28249226	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic triggered specifically the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes in exposed R. arenarum embryo and larvae.
28249226	In particular, the expression levels of SOD, CAT and GST enzymes analyzed by Western blot showed a similar behavior to their enzymatic activities in our previous work.
28249226	This fact suggests that not only the synthesis of these antioxidant enzymes but also their rapid degradation after inactivation would be regulated in response to ROS levels.
28249226	Antioxidant enzymes may show dual responses of induction and inactivation followed by degradation depending on the levels of oxidative stress and impact on ROS targets when the exposure is sustained in time and intensity.
28249226	We also performed a probability of exceedence analysis including our previous results to visualize a progression of the response in time and also established the best early-responding biomarkers at the lowest As concentrations.
28249226	As a conclusion, the molecular biomarkers such as the MAPKs GENE_5609_MEK and GENE_5594_ERK and transcription factors GENE_2353_c_FOS and GENE_3725_c_JUN are early induced in the response of developing toad embryos exposed to very low As concentrations in water.
28249226	The advantage of counting with molecular biomarkers early responding to low concentrations of As in a chronic exposure is that they may anticipate the irreversible damage at later developmental stages due to the constant oxidative challenge.
28249781	Assessment of anti-cancerous potential of CHEMICAL_C007845_6_gingerol (Tongling White Ginger) and its synergy with drugs on SPECIES_9606_human cervical DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinoma cells.
28249781	The anti-cancerous activity of CHEMICAL_C007845_6_gingerol extracted from Tongling White Ginger was investigated.
28249781	CHEMICAL_C007845_6_Gingerol inhibited the growth of HeLa cells with IC50 (96.32  M) and IC80 (133.01  M) and led to morphological changes, induced the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1-phase and ultimately resulted into apoptosis.
28249781	Among cell cycle-related genes and proteins, the expression of GENE_6080;890;595_cyclin_A_D1_E1_ reduced, while of GENE_983_CDK_1, GENE_644914_p21 and GENE_10671_p27 showed slight decrease, except GENE_891_cyclin_B1 and E1 (protein).
28249781	Western blotting reported the induction of apoptosis with an increased GENE_581_Bax/GENE_596_Bcl_2 ratio, release of GENE_54205_cytochrome_c, cleavage of GENE_836_caspase_3_8_9 and PRPP in treated cells.
28249781	CHEMICAL_C007845_6_Gingerol activated AMPK, but inhibited GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation with reduced GENE_6198_P70S6K expression and also suppressed the GENE_2475_mTOR phosphorylation.
28249781	CHEMICAL_C007845_6_Gingerol with CHEMICAL_D005472_5_FU and Ptx resulted in 83.2% and 52% inhibition respectively, this synergy have stimulated apoptosis proteins more efficiently as compared to CHEMICAL_C007845_6_Gingerol alone (10.75%) under in  vitro conditions.
28248286	CHEMICAL__Fluorene_9_bisphenol is anti-oestrogenic and may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28248286	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is used in the production of plastic but has oestrogenic activity.
28248286	Therefore, CHEMICAL__BPA substitutes, such as CHEMICAL__fluorene_9_bisphenol (CHEMICAL__BHPF), have been introduced for the production of so-called 'CHEMICAL__BPA-free' plastics.
28248286	Here we show that BHPF is released from commercial 'CHEMICAL__BPA-free' plastic bottles into drinking water and has anti-oestrogenic effects in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28248286	We demonstrate that BHPF has anti-oestrogenic activity in vitro and, in an uterotrophic assay in SPECIES_10090_mice, induces low uterine weight, DISEASE_D016109_atrophic endometria and causes adverse pregnancy outcomes, even at doses lower than those of CHEMICAL__BPA for which no observed adverse effect have been reported.
28248286	Female SPECIES_10090_mice given water containing BHPF released from plastic bottles, have detectable levels of BHPF in serum, low uterine weights and show decreased expressions of CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen-responsive genes.
28248286	We also detect BHPF in the plasma of 7/100 individuals, who regularly drink water from plastic bottles.
28248286	Our data suggest that CHEMICAL__BPA substitutes should be tested for anti-oestrogenic activity and call for further study of the toxicological effects of BHPF on SPECIES_9606_human health.
28249227	Effects of food-borne exposure of juvenile SPECIES_8022_rainbow_trout (SPECIES_8022_Oncorhynchus_mykiss) to emerging brominated flame retardants CHEMICAL_C081014_1_2_bis_2_4_6_tribromophenoxy_ethane and CHEMICAL_C576261_2_ethylhexyl_2_3_4_5_tetrabromobenzoate.
28249227	Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) represent a large group of chemicals used in a variety of household and commercial products to prevent fire propagation.
28249227	The environmental persistence and DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of some of the most widely used BFRs has resulted in a progressive ban worldwide and the development of novel BFRs for which the knowledge on environmental health impacts remains limited.
28249227	The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of two emerging BFRs, CHEMICAL_C081014_1_2_bis_2_4_6_tribromophenoxy_ethane (CHEMICAL__BTBPE) and CHEMICAL_C576261_2_ethylhexyl_2_3_4_5_tetrabromobenzoate (CHEMICAL__EH_TBB), in diet exposed juvenile SPECIES_8022_rainbow_trout (SPECIES_8022_Oncorhynchus_mykiss).
28249227	Both compounds were detected in fish carcasses at 76% and 2% of the daily dosage of CHEMICAL__BTBPE and CHEMICAL__EH_TBB, respectively, indicating accumulation of CHEMICAL__BTBPE and by contrast extensive depuration/metabolism of CHEMICAL__EH_TBB.
28249227	Liver gene transcription analysis using RNA-sequencing indicated that the chronic 28-d dietary exposure of trout to CHEMICAL__EH_TBB down-regulated one single gene related to endocrine-mediated processes, whereas CHEMICAL__BTBPE impacted the transcription of 33 genes, including genes involved in the immune response, reproduction, and oxidative stress.
28249227	Additional analysis using qRT-PCR after 48-h and 28-d of exposure confirmed the impact of CHEMICAL__BTBPE on immune related genes in the liver (apolipoprotein A-I, lysozyme) and the head-kidney (complement c3-4).
28249227	However, the activity of lysozymes measured at the protein level did not reflect transcriptomic results.
28249227	Overall, results suggested an impact on immune-related gene transcription in CHEMICAL__BTBPE exposed fish, as well as oxidative stress and endocrine disruption potentials.
28254521	Biological evaluation of a CHEMICAL__halogenated_triterpenoid, CHEMICAL__2a_bromo_dihydrobelulonic_acid as inhibitor of SPECIES_9606_human topoisomerase IIa and HeLa cell proliferation.
28254521	BACKGROUND: The CHEMICAL__pentacyclic_lupane-type (6-6-6-6-5 type) triterpenoid, CHEMICAL_C002070_Betulinic_acid (BA) is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerases and is of immense interest as anticancer drugs.
28254521	However, the compound being highly lipophilic, has limited in  vivo uptake capacity.
28254521	BA derivatives with CHEMICAL_24473_halogen substituent at GENE_717_C_2 have improved membrane permeability and DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity against DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells.
28254521	AIM: The CHEMICAL__halogenated_triterpenoid, CHEMICAL__2a_bromo_dihydrobetulonic_acid (B1) was synthesized from CHEMICAL_C002070_betulinic_acid (BA) isolated from Bischofia javanica.
28254521	Aim of the study was to determine whether B1 could act as a more efficient inhibitor of Topo IIa activity and HeLa cell proliferation, in comparison to BA.
28254521	RESULT: B1 displayed efficient inhibition of DNA relaxation activity of topoisomerase IIa and the inhibitory effect was markedly improved upon pre-incubation of the compound with enzyme.
28254521	Topoisomerase IIa inhibition by B1 was relieved in presence of increasing concentrations of DNA suggesting the compound as a reversible catalytic inhibitor.
28254521	Subsequent UV and fluorescence spectroscopy studies indicated that B1 interacts and intercalates with DNA at concentrations signicantly greater than that required for topoisomerase IIa inhibition.
28254521	The compound showed cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells with significantly lower IC50 value (7.5   M) as compared to that of BA (30   M) and had very low damaging/cytotoxic effect on normal cells.
28254521	Treatment of B1 impaired HeLa cell proliferation by inducing CHEMICAL__Go_G1 arrest through lowered expression of GENE_595_cyclin_D1 and GENE_5111_PCNA polypeptides, and enhanced expression of GENE_644914_p21.
28254521	B1 treatment also increased the accumulation of early and late apoptotic cells in a concentration dependent manner as indicated by GENE_308_annexin_V-CHEMICAL_D016650_FITC/PI binding assay.
28251819	Cis-bifenthrin induces immunotoxicity in adolescent male C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice.
28251819	CHEMICAL_C099952_Bifenthrin (BF) is an important synthetic CHEMICAL__pyrethroid.
28251819	Previous studies have demonstrated that CHEMICAL__cis_BF exhibits toxic effects on development, the neurological, reproductive and endocrine system.
28251819	In this study, we evaluated the immunotoxicity caused by CHEMICAL__cis_BF in adolescent male C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice.
28251819	SPECIES_10090_Mice were exposed orally to 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d for 3 weeks.
28251819	The results showed that body weight, spleen weight, and splenic cellularity decreased in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to 20 mg/kg/d CHEMICAL__cis_BF.
28251819	Additionally, we found that the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory factors GENE_10090)_IL_1b, GENE_10090)_IL_6, GENE_10090)_CXCL_1, and GENE_10090)_TNF_a, in peritoneal macrophages, the spleen, and the thymus were inhibited in the CHEMICAL__cis_BF-treated groups.
28251819	Moreover, CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assays demonstrated that CHEMICAL__cis_BF inhibited splenocyte proliferation stimulated by LPS or Con A, as well as the secretion of IFN-y on Con A stimulation.
28251819	Collectively, the results of this study suggest that exposure to CHEMICAL__cis_BF has the potential to induce immunotoxicity in adolescent male C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice.
28257781	Diet high in CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose promotes DISEASE_D005234_liver_steatosis and hepatocyte apoptosis in C57BL/6J female SPECIES_10090_mice: Role of disturbed lipid homeostasis and increased oxidative stress.
28257781	The effects of high (H)-CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose (FR) diet (D) (HFRD) on hepatic lipid homeostasis, oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis were investigated in 6-week old female C57BL/6J SPECIES_10090_mice fed a regular chow (ContD) or HFRD (35% CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose-derived calories) for 3 weeks.
28257781	HFRD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice exhibited increased levels of DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis with a significant elevation of serum levels of CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride, CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol and GENE_10090)_TNFa compared to ContD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice (P<0.05).
28257781	HFRD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice exhibited    2.7- fold higher levels FAS along with significantly decreased protein levels of adiponection-R2 (   30%), P-AMPK (   60%), P-ACC (   70%) and RXR-a (   55%), suggesting decreased hepatic fat oxidation compared to controls.
28257781	Interestingly, hepatic CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid uptake into hepatocytes and lipolysis were significantly increased in HFRD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice, as shown by decreased GENE_10090)_CD36 and CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid transporter protein-2, and increased adipose CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride lipase, respectively (P<0.05).
28257781	Increased hepatic levels of iNOS and GSSG/CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH suggest elevated oxidative stress with a higher number of macrophages in the adipose tissue in HFRD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice (P<0.05).
28257781	Significantly elevated rates of hepatocyte apoptosis (   2.4-fold), as determined by TUNEL analysis with increased GENE_10090)_Bax/GENE_10090)_Bcl2 ratio and GENE_10090)_PARP_1 levels (   2- and 1.5-fold, respectively), were observed in HFRD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28257781	Thus, HFRD exposure increased DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis accompanied by oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, leading to hepatocyte apoptosis.
28257955	Sex hormones reduce CHEMICAL__NNK detoxification through inhibition of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases and aldo-keto reductases in  vitro.
28257955	CHEMICAL_23019_Carbonyl reduction is an important metabolic pathway for endogenous and xenobiotic substances.
28257955	The SPECIES_4097_tobacco specific CHEMICAL__nitrosamine_4_methylnitrosamino_1_3_pyridyl_1_butanone (CHEMICAL__NNK, CHEMICAL_D009538_nicotine-derived CHEMICAL__nitrosamine_ketone) is classified as carcinogenic to SPECIES_9606_humans (IARC, Group 1) and considered to play the most important role in SPECIES_4097_tobacco-related lung DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28257955	Detoxification of CHEMICAL__NNK through CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl reduction is catalyzed by members of the AKR- and the GENE_8436_SDR-superfamilies which include GENE_57016_AKR1B10, GENE_1645_AKR1C1, GENE_1646_AKR1C2, GENE_1109_AKR1C4, 11b-GENE_26871_HSD1 and GENE_873_CBR1.
28257955	Because some reductases are also involved in CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid metabolism, five different hormones were tested for their inhibitory effect on CHEMICAL__NNK_carbonyl reduction.
28257955	Two of those hormones were CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens (CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol and CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinylestradiol), another two hormones belong to the gestagen group (CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone and CHEMICAL_C035144_drospirenone) and the last tested hormone was an CHEMICAL_50113_androgen (CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone).
28257955	Furthermore, one of the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens (CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinylestradiol) and one of the CHEMICAL_D011372_gestagens (CHEMICAL_C035144_drospirenone) are synthetic hormones, used as hormonal contraceptives.
28257955	Five of six CHEMICAL__NNK reducing enzymes (GENE_57016_AKR1B10, GENE_1645_AKR1C1, GENE_1646_AKR1C2, GENE_1109_AKR1C4 and 11b-GENE_26871_HSD1) were significantly inhibited by the tested sex hormones.
28257955	Only CHEMICAL__NNK reduction catalyzed by GENE_873_CBR1 was not significantly impaired.
28257955	In the case of the other five reductases, gestagens had remarkably stronger inhibitory effects at a concentration of 25   M (CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone: 66-88% inhibition; CHEMICAL_C035144_drospirenone: 26-87% inhibition) in comparison to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens (CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol: 17-51% inhibition; CHEMICAL_D004997_ethinylestradiol: 14-79% inhibition) and CHEMICAL_D000728_androgens (14-78% inhibition).
28257955	Moreover, in most cases the synthetic hormones showed a greater ability to inhibit CHEMICAL__NNK reduction than the physiologic derivatives.
28257955	These results demonstrate that male and female sex hormones have different inhibitory potentials, thus indicating that there is a varying detoxification capacity of CHEMICAL__NNK in SPECIES_9606_men and SPECIES_9606_women which could result in a different risk for developing DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer.
28259689	Modulation of neuro-inflammatory condition, GENE_10090)_acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant levels by CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein attenuates DISEASE_D003920_diabetes associated DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_decline in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28259689	The association of DISEASE_D003920_diabetes and DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_decline may indicate that high CHEMICAL__sugar level might be a risk factor for DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease.
28259689	A collective term 'DISEASE_D003920_diabetes associated DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_decline' (DACD) has been coined for the SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D017827_type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes_mellitus showing decline in their cognitive function, especially DISEASE_D003072_weak_episodic_memory_cognitive_inflexibility and poor psychomotor performance leading towards DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease.
28259689	However, at present, no specific treatment exists for the prevention and/or treatment of DACD.
28259689	CHEMICAL_D019833_Genistein, an CHEMICAL_18220_isoflavone phytoestrogen, reveals neuroprotective effects in many experimental SPECIES_10090_murine models, though its role on DACD with probable mechanistic approach has still been scope for research.
28259689	The motive behind the present study is to investigate the outcome of CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein treatment against DACD in CHEMICAL_D013311_streptozotocin-induced DISEASE_D003920_diabetic_mice with Morris water maze paradigm followed by open field trial to rule out the possibility of DISEASE_D009069_impairment_in_locomotor_performance.
28259689	Chronic (30 days) CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein treatment (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0  mg/kg, i.p.
28259689	once daily) in DISEASE_D003920_diabetic_mice significantly lowered DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia, recovered cognitive performance by affecting GENE_10090)_acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidative stress and ameliorated neuro-inflammatory condition by varying GENE_10090)_TNF_a, GENE_10090)_IL_1b and CHEMICAL_16301_nitrite levels as impaired in DISEASE_D003920_diabetic_mice.
28259689	Thirty days treatment with CHEMICAL_D001205_vitamin_C or CHEMICAL_D008687_metformin also improved DISEASE_D003920_diabetes-induced DISEASE_D008569_memory_impairment and significantly dragged these biochemical parameters towards respective controls.
28259689	Locomotor performance was not influenced by DISEASE_D003920_diabetic_condition or any associated treatment.
28259689	It is concluded that CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein supplementation might be a prospective therapeutic approach for the treatment and/or avoidance of DISEASE_D007859_diabetic_linked_learning_and_memory_dysfunction.
28259788	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A, CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S, CHEMICAL__bisphenol_F and CHEMICAL_C583074_bisphenol_AF induce different oxidative stress and damage in SPECIES_9606_human red blood cells (in vitro study).
28259788	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and its analogs are widely used in the production of various everyday use products, which leads to a common exposure of SPECIES_9606_humans to these substances.
28259788	The effect of CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols on oxidative stress parameters has not been described in detail in non-nucleated cells, therefore, we have decided to evaluate the impact of CHEMICAL__BPA and its analogs, i.e.
28259788	CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS), CHEMICAL__bisphenol_F (CHEMICAL__BPF) and CHEMICAL_C583074_bisphenol_AF (CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF) on DISEASE_D000860_reactive_oxygen_species (DISEASE_D000860_ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH) level and the activities of CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (GENE_6647_SOD), GENE_847_catalase (GENE_847_CAT) and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-Px) in SPECIES_9606_human erythrocytes.
28259788	The erythrocytes were incubated with the compounds studied in the concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 500 g/ml for 1, 4 or 24h.
28259788	It has been found that CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols enhanced DISEASE_D000860_ROS (including<sup>   </sup>CHEMICAL_C031356_OH) formation, depleted CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH level, increased lipid peroxidation and changed the activities of GENE_6647_SOD, GENE_847_CAT and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-Px.
28259788	It has been noted that the strongest alterations in DISEASE_D000860_ROS formation, lipid peroxidation and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were induced by CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF, which changed GENE_847_CAT and GENE_6647_SOD activity even at 0.5 g/ml.
28259788	It has also been shown that CHEMICAL__BPA caused the strongest changes in CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH level, while CHEMICAL__BPS, which is the main CHEMICAL__BPA substituent in the manufacture did not alter most parameters studied.
28263720	CHEMICAL_D019821_Simvastatin down-regulates differential genetic profiles produced by CHEMICAL__organochlorine mixtures in primary breast cell (HMEC).
28263720	SPECIES_9606_Women all over the world are exposed to an unavoidable contamination by CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticides and other chemical pollutants.
28263720	Many of them are considered as xenoestrogens and have been associated with the development and progression of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28263720	We have demonstrated that the most prevalent pesticide mixtures found in healthy SPECIES_9606_women and in SPECIES_9606_women diagnosed with DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer modulates the gene expression in SPECIES_9606_human epithelial mammary cells.
28263720	Statins are well-known CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol-depleting agents acting as inhibitors of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol synthesis.
28263720	Since the early 1990s, it has been known that statins could be successfully used in DISEASE_D009369_cancer therapy, including DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer, but the exact mechanism behind anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor activity of the statins remains unclear.
28263720	In the present study we evaluated the effect of CHEMICAL_D019821_simvastatin in the gene expression pattern induced by realistic CHEMICAL__organochlorine mixtures found in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer SPECIES_9606_patients.
28263720	The gene expression of 94 genes related with the cell signaling pathways were assessed.
28263720	Our results indicate that CHEMICAL_D019821_simvastatin exerts a global down regulating effect on successfully determined genes (78.7%), thus attenuating the effects induced by CHEMICAL__organochlorine mixtures on the gene profile of SPECIES_9606_human mammary epithelial cells.
28263720	This effect was more evident on genes whose function is the CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-binding process (that also were particularly up-regulated by pesticide mixtures).
28263720	We also found that GENE_10461_MERTK (a proto-oncogene which is overexpressed in several DISEASE_D009369_malignancies) and GENE_5159_PDGFRB (a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family whose expression is high in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells that have become resistant to endocrine therapy) were among the genes with a higher differential regulation by CHEMICAL_D019821_simvastatin.
28263720	Since resistance to treatment with CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine kinase inhibitors is closely related to MERKT, our findings would enhance the possible utility of statins in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer treatment, i.e.
28263720	improving therapeutic results combining CHEMICAL_D019821_statins with CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.
28263824	Suppressive immunoregulatory effects of three antidepressants via inhibition of the nuclear factor-kB activation assessed using primary macrophages of SPECIES_7962_carp (SPECIES_7962_Cyprinus_carpio).
28263824	Antidepressants, having been applied for the treatment of major DISEASE_D003866_depressive_disorder and other conditions for decades, are among the most commonly detected SPECIES_9606_human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.
28263824	This study evaluated the immunotoxicity of acute exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CHEMICAL_D000639_amitriptyline, CHEMICAL_D005473_fluoxetine and mianserin using an in vitro primary macrophage model isolated from red SPECIES_7962_common_carp (SPECIES_7962_Cyprinus_carpio), and also explored their potential mechanisms of action.
28263824	A potential suppressive immunoregulatory effect of antidepressant exposure was suggested based on the observed suppressive effects on oxidative stress parameters, bactericidal activity, NO production, and NO synthase activity, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and a significant stimulatory effect on anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and interferon cytokine gene expression and ATPase activities in macrophages after 6h-exposure to three individual antidepressants and a combination thereof.
28263824	Notably, we also found these effects were significantly associated with a corresponding decrease in nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activity after antidepressants exposure, and the NF-kB antagonist significantly restrained the effects of antidepressants on gene expression of cytokines, indicating that antidepressants could alter the response of various immune-associated components via the inhibition of NF-kB.
28263824	Moreover, time-dependent lethal concentrations of three antidepressants on primary macrophages were firstly determined at mg/L levels, and the synergetic effects of antidepressant mixtures were suggested and in particular, for some parameters including total antioxidant capacity and cytokine genes expression, they could be significantly affected by antidepressants exposure at concentrations as low as 10ng/L, which together thereby revealed the potential risk of antidepressants to aquatic life.
28266762	Downregulation of GENE_10116)_HIF1_a, GENE_10116)_Smad_2, GENE_10116)_AKT, and GENE_10116)_Bax gene expression in CHEMICAL_D012977_sodium_nitrite-induced lung injury via some antioxidants.
28266762	The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of pretreatment with either CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine (CHEMICAL_16467_L_arg) or CHEMICAL_D002336_Carnosine (CHEMICAL__Car) and their combination in ameliorating some of the biochemical indices induced in the lung of CHEMICAL_D012977_sodium_nitrite (CHEMICAL__NaNO2 )-intoxicated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28266762	The results revealed that CHEMICAL__NaNO2 significantly increased serum tumor necrosis factor-a, GENE_10116)_C_reactive_protein, heat shock proteins-70, vascular endothelial growth factor, and GENE_10116)_Interleukin_6.
28266762	Moreover, transforming growth factor-b, hypoxia-inducible factor, GENE_10116)_Smad_2, Protein Kinase B (GENE_10116)_AKT), and GENE_10116)_Bax were overexpressed, whereas GENE_10116)_Bcl2 protein was downregulated compared with the normoxic group.
28266762	The administration of the fore mentioned antioxidants, either alone or in combination, markedly downregulated the previously mentioned inflammatory, apoptotic, as well as the fibrotic markers in lung tissue compared with the CHEMICAL__NaNO2 -intoxicated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28266762	The histopathological examination reinforced the previous results.
28266762	In conclusion, the current data revealed the efficacy of CHEMICAL_16467_l_arg and CHEMICAL__Car in ameliorating the pulmonary damage via suppression of the inflammatory markers in response to CHEMICAL__NaNO2 -intoxication.
28266762	Interestingly the combination regimen showed the most significant effect.
28263783	Establishment of a novel SPECIES_10090_mouse model for CHEMICAL_C060836_pioglitazone-induced skeletal DISEASE_D009135_muscle_injury.
28263783	Skeletal muscle (SKM) injury is one of the major safety concerns in risk assessment for drug development.
28263783	However, no appropriate pre-clinical animal model exists to evaluate drug-induced DISEASE_D009135_SKM_injury except that caused by fibrates and CHEMICAL_D019821_statins.
28263783	CHEMICAL_C089946_Thiazolidinedione, a PPARy agonistic drug for DISEASE_D003920_type_2_diabetes_mellitus, is widely used clinically but can induce adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and DISEASE_D009135_SKM_injury, as has been reported in recent decades.
28263783	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C089946_thiazolidinedione-induced DISEASE_D009135_SKM_injury has only been reported in SPECIES_9606_humans, and no evidence of DISEASE_D009135_SKM_injury has been observed in rodents.
28263783	To establish a drug-induced SKM DISEASE_D014947_injury_mouse model, we administered CHEMICAL_C060836_pioglitazone with a CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor, CHEMICAL__L_buthionine_S_R_sulfoximine, to SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6J SPECIES_10090_mice for 2days and subsequently observed prominent increases in plasma CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate aminotransferase and CHEMICAL_D003404_creatinine phosphokinase, which were associated with SKM lesions.
28263783	Furthermore, plasma GENE_406989_miR_206 (SKM-specific microRNA) level was significantly increased, whereas plasma GENE_406990_miR_208 (heart-specific microRNA) was not detected, indicating that CHEMICAL_C060836_pioglitazone specifically caused SKM, not cardiac, injury.
28263783	Furthermore, we revealed that CHEMICAL_C060836_pioglitazone-induced DISEASE_D009135_SKM_injury was caused by oxidative stress that was independent of the PPARy agonistic effect.
28263783	This study demonstrated for the first time that the CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-depleted SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6J SPECIES_10090_mouse is a novel model for assessing drug-induced DISEASE_D009135_SKM_injury in drug development.
28263823	Embryotoxic and pharmacologic potency ranking of six CHEMICAL_D001393_azoles in the SPECIES_10116_rat whole embryo culture by morphological and transcriptomic analysis.
28263823	Differential gene expression analysis in the SPECIES_10116_rat whole embryo culture (WEC) assay provides mechanistic insight into the embryotoxicity of test compounds.
28263823	In our study, we hypothesized that comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of SPECIES_10116_rat embryos exposed to six CHEMICAL_D001393_azoles (CHEMICAL_C061365_flusilazole, CHEMICAL_C032910_triadimefon, CHEMICAL_D007654_ketoconazole, CHEMICAL_D008825_miconazole, CHEMICAL_C115058_difenoconazole and CHEMICAL_C550005_prothioconazole) could lead to a better mechanism-based understanding of their embryotoxicity and pharmacological action.
28263823	For evaluating embryotoxicity, we applied the DISEASE_D009421_total_morphological_scoring_system (DISEASE_D009421_TMS) in embryos exposed for 48h.
28263823	The compounds tested showed embryotoxicity in a dose-response fashion.
28263823	Functional analysis of differential gene expression after 4h exposure at the ID10 (effective dose for 10% decreased DISEASE_D009421_TMS), revealed the CHEMICAL_15889_sterol biosynthesis pathway and embryonic development genes, dominated by genes in the CHEMICAL_D014212_retinoic_acid (RA) pathway, albeit in a differential way.
28263823	CHEMICAL_C061365_Flusilazole, CHEMICAL_D007654_ketoconazole and CHEMICAL_C032910_triadimefon were the most potent compounds affecting the RA pathway, while in terms of regulation of CHEMICAL_15889_sterol function, CHEMICAL_C115058_difenoconazole and CHEMICAL_D007654_ketoconazole showed the most pronounced effects.
28263823	Dose-dependent analysis of the effects of CHEMICAL_C061365_flusilazole revealed that the RA pathway related genes were already differentially expressed at low dose levels while the CHEMICAL_15889_sterol pathway showed strong regulation at higher embryotoxic doses, suggesting that this pathway is less predictive for the observed embryotoxicity.
28263823	A similar analysis at the 24-hour time point indicated an additional time-dependent difference in the aforementioned pathways regulated by CHEMICAL_C061365_flusilazole.
28263823	In summary, the SPECIES_10116_rat WEC assay in combination with transcriptomics could add a mechanistic insight into the embryotoxic potency ranking and pharmacological mode of action of the tested compounds.
28263910	DISEASE_D003866_Depressive-like effect of prenatal exposure to CHEMICAL_D003634_DDT involves global DNA hypomethylation and impairment of GENE_10090)_GPER1/GENE_10090)_ESR1 protein levels but not GENE_10090)_ESR2 and GENE_10090)_AHR/GENE_10090)_ARNT signaling.
28263910	Several lines of evidence suggest that exposures to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) such as pesticides increase the risks of DISEASE_D001523_neuropsychiatric_disorders.
28263910	Despite extended residual persistence of CHEMICAL_16130_dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (CHEMICAL_D003634_DDT) in the environment, the mechanisms of perinatal actions of CHEMICAL_D003634_DDT that could account for adult-onset of DISEASE_D003866_depression are largely unknown.
28263910	This study demonstrated the isomer-specific induction of DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like behavior and impairment of GENE_10090)_Htr1a/CHEMICAL_D012701_serotonin signaling in one-month-old SPECIES_10090_mice that were prenatally exposed to CHEMICAL_D003634_DDT.
28263910	The effects were reversed by the antidepressant CHEMICAL_D015283_citalopram as evidenced in the forced swimming (FST) and tail suspension (TST) tests in the male and female SPECIES_10090_mice.
28263910	Prenatally administered CHEMICAL_D003634_DDT accumulated in SPECIES_10090_mouse brain as determined with gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, led to global DNA hypomethylation, and altered the levels of methylated DNA in specific genes.
28263910	The induction of DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like behavior and impairment of GENE_10090)_Htr1a/CHEMICAL_D012701_serotonin signaling were accompanied by CHEMICAL_D003634_p_p_DDT-specific decrease in the levels of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors i.e.
28263910	GENE_10090)_ESR1 and/or GENE_10090)_GPER1 depending on sex.
28263910	In contrast, CHEMICAL_C016340_o_p_DDT did not induce DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like effects and exhibited quite distinct pattern of biochemical alterations that was related to CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor (GENE_10090)_AHR), its nuclear translocator GENE_10090)_ARNT, and GENE_10090)_ESR2.
28263910	Exposure to CHEMICAL_C016340_o_p_DDT increased GENE_10090)_AHR expression in male and female brains, and reduced expression levels of GENE_10090)_ARNT and GENE_10090)_ESR2 in the female brains.
28263910	The evolution of CHEMICAL_D003634_p_p_DDT-induced DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like behavior was preceded by attenuation of GENE_10090)_Htr1a and GENE_10090)_Gper1/GENE_10090)_GPER1 expression as observed in the 7-day-old SPECIES_10090_mouse pups.
28263910	Because CHEMICAL_D003634_p_p_DDT caused sex- and age-independent attenuation of GENE_10090)_GPER1, we suggest that impairment of GENE_10090)_GPER1 signaling plays a key role in the propagation of CHEMICAL_D003634_DDT-induced DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like symptoms.
28268219	Treg Cells Protect Dopaminergic Neurons against CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ DISEASE_D020258_Neurotoxicity via GENE_961_CD47-GENE_140885_SIRPA Interaction.
28268219	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Regulatory T (Treg) cells have been associated with neuroprotection by inhibiting microglial activation in animal models of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD), a progressive DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disease characterized by dopaminergic DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_loss in the nigrostriatal system.
28268219	Herein, we show that Treg cells directly protect dopaminergic neurons against CHEMICAL_D015655_1_methyl_4_phenylpyridinium (CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_) DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity via an interaction between the two transmembrane proteins GENE_961_CD47 and GENE_140885_signal_regulatory_protein_a (GENE_140885_SIRPA).
28268219	METHODS: Primary ventral mesencephalic (VM) cells or VM neurons were pretreated with Treg cells before CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ treatment.
28268219	Transwell co-culture of Treg cells and VM neurons was used to assess the effects of the Treg cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 and interleukin (IL)-10 on dopaminergic neurons.
28268219	Live cell imaging system detected a dynamic contact of Treg cells with VM neurons that were stained with GENE_961_CD47 and GENE_140885_SIRPA, respectively.
28268219	Dopaminergic DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_loss, which was assessed by the number of CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive cells, was examined after silencing GENE_961_CD47 in Treg cells or silencing GENE_140885_SIRPA in VM neurons.
28268219	RESULTS: Treg cells prevented CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-induced dopaminergic DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_loss and glial inflammatory responses.
28268219	GENE_7040_TGF_b1 and GENE_3586_IL_10 secreted from Treg cells did not significantly prevent CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-induced dopaminergic DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_loss in transwell co-culture of Treg cells and VM neurons.
28268219	GENE_961_CD47 and GENE_140885_SIRPA were expressed by Treg cells and VM neurons, respectively.
28268219	GENE_961_CD47-labeled Treg cells dynamically contacted with GENE_140885_SIRPA-labeled VM neurons.
28268219	Silencing GENE_961_CD47 gene in Treg cells impaired the ability of Treg cells to protect dopaminergic neurons against CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28268219	Similarly, GENE_140885_SIRPA knockdown in VM neurons reduced the ability of Treg cell neuroprotection.
28268219	GENE_5879_Rac1/GENE_207_Akt signaling pathway in VM neurons was activated by GENE_961_CD47-GENE_140885_SIRPA interaction between Treg cells and the neurons.
28268219	Inhibiting GENE_5879_Rac1/GENE_207_Akt signaling in VM neurons compromised Treg cell neuroprotection.
28268219	CONCLUSION: Treg cells protect dopaminergic neurons against CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity by a cell-to-cell contact mechanism underlying GENE_961_CD47-GENE_140885_SIRPA interaction and GENE_5879_Rac1/GENE_207_Akt activation.
28267586	Maternal CHEMICAL_D002220_carbamazepine alters fetal neuroendocrine-cytokines axis.
28267586	This study detected the impact of maternal CHEMICAL_D002220_carbamazepine (CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ) on the fetal neuroendocrine-cytokines axis.
28267586	25 or 50mg/kg of CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ was intraperitoneally administrated to pregnant albino SPECIES_10116_rats from the gestation day (GD) 1 to 20.
28267586	Both administrations of CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ caused a DISEASE_D007037_hypothyroidism in dams and SPECIES_10090_fetuses whereas the decreases in serum CHEMICAL_D013974_thyroxine (T4) and CHEMICAL_D014284_triiodothyronine (T3) and increases in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels were highly significant (LSD; P <0.01) at GD 20 compared to untreated control dams.
28267586	Also, both administrations had undesirable impacts on the maternofetal body weight, litter weight, survival of dams and SPECIES_10090_fetuses, and their food consumption in comparison to the corresponding control.
28267586	These administrations also elicited a reduction in fetal serum GENE_2688_growth_hormone (GENE_2688_GH), interferon-y (IFNy), interleukins (GENE_11009_IL_2_4) and CHEMICAL_D015232_prostaglandin_E2 (CHEMICAL_D015232_PGE2) levels.
28267586	Also, the elevation in fetal serum GENE_7124_tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha (GENE_7124_TNFa), GENE_7040_transforming_growth_factor_beta (GENE_7040_TGFb), and interleukins (GENE_3553_IL_1b _ 17) levels was observed at embryonic day (ED) 20.
28267586	Moreover, there were a cellular fragmentation, DISEASE_D006311_distortion, DISEASE_D006940_hyperemia, DISEASE_D004487_oedema and vacuolation in the DISEASE_D002526_fetal_cerebellar_cortex due to both maternal administrations.
28267586	These developmental changes were dose-dependent.
28267586	These novel results suggest that CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ may act as a developmental immunoneuroendocrine disruptor.
28267632	Reduced expression of selective immune-related genes in CHEMICAL_D012834_silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) monocytes exposed to CHEMICAL_D001280_atrazine.
28267632	The effect of CHEMICAL_D001280_atrazine (CHEMICAL_37924_ATZ) and its metabolites on aquatic vertebrate species has been a matter of concern to researchers and environmentalist.
28267632	In this study we exposed head kidney monocytes to sublethal concentrations of CHEMICAL_D001280_atrazine (1 and 10   g/ml(-1)), corresponding to 1% and 10% of the LC50-96h, to evaluate the expression of immune-related genes central to immune stimulation.
28267632	The mRNA levels of GENE_7124_TNF_a, Mieloperoxidase and Mx genes were significantly reduced following 24  h exposure to both concentrations of CHEMICAL_37924_ATZ.
28267632	The mRNA levels of GENE_51135_iRAK4 were reduced only at the higher CHEMICAL_37924_ATZ concentration and the mRNA levels of GENE_3553_IL_1b were not affected.
28267632	The results reported here support our previous findings on the immunosuppressive effect of CHEMICAL_37924_ATZ indicating its potential to interfere with the expression of immune-related genes, and strengthen the need to regulate CHEMICAL_37924_ATZ usage aiming to preserve animal and SPECIES_9606_human health.
28273962	CHEMICAL__Organochlorine Pesticide-Mediated Induction of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH Oxidase and CHEMICAL_D009569_Nitric_Oxide Synthase in Endothelial Cell.
28273962	INTRODUCTION: CHEMICAL_38656_Organochlorine_Pesticides (CHEMICAL__OCPs) are detected ubiquitously in SPECIES_9606_human and have been shown to be associated with DISEASE_D002318_Cardiovascular_Disease (DISEASE_D002318_CVD) and DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28273962	AIM: To find out the effect of CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticides in endothelial cell with regard to oxidative stress and associated expression of enzymes producing CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide and CHEMICAL_D009569_Nitric_Oxide (NO).
28273962	MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPECIES_9606_Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were cultured and treated with four CHEMICAL__OCPs which were found in SPECIES_9606_human blood at a concentration of 0.1 M. The cells were tested for DISEASE_D000860_Reactive_Oxygen_Species (DISEASE_D000860_ROS) generation, NO production and mRNA expression of NAPDH oxidase (GENE_653361_p47phox) and GENE_4846_endothelial_Nitric_Oxide_Synthase (eNOS).
28273962	DISEASE_D000860_ROS generation was measured by using CHEMICAL_C110400_2_7_dichlorodihydrofluorescein_diacetate (CHEMICAL_C110400_H2DCFDA) method.
28273962	NO was analysed by Bioxytech CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide assay kit method and mRNA of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase and eNOS was quantified by real time PCR.
28273962	Data were expressed as the mean  SEM.
28273962	Comparison between the groups were made by student's t-test (2-tailed) or one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc analysis depending on number of groups.
28273962	For all statistical tests, p< 0.05 was considered to be significant.
28273962	RESULTS: All the four pesticides generated DISEASE_D000860_ROS accompanied by enhanced expression of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase.
28273962	Maximum effect was observed with CHEMICAL__b_endosulfan.
28273962	Level of NO was found to be decreased significantly in endothelial cells treated with these pesticides accompanied by enhanced expression of eNOS.
28273962	The antioxidant CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) reduced DISEASE_D000860_ROS generation and enhanced NO formation.
28273962	Pesticide-mediated DISEASE_D000860_ROS generation possibly reacts with NO forming CHEMICAL__peroxinitrite and thereby reducing the bioavailability of NO although eNOS expression is increased.
28273962	CONCLUSION: CHEMICAL__OCPs induce DISEASE_D008107_endothelial_dysfunction through increased DISEASE_D000860_ROS generation via CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase expression and reduced bioavailability of CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide.
28282128	Activation of GENE_5468_Peroxisome_Proliferator_Activated_Receptor_Gamma and Disruption of CHEMICAL_D011374_Progesterone Synthesis of CHEMICAL_C018535_2_Ethylhexyl_Diphenyl_Phosphate in SPECIES_9606_Human DISEASE_D002822_Placental_Choriocarcinoma Cells: Comparison with CHEMICAL_C005445_Triphenyl_Phosphate.
28282128	CHEMICAL_C018535_2_Ethylhexyl_diphenyl_phosphate (CHEMICAL__EHDPP), an CHEMICAL_D010755_organophosphate flame retardant (OPFR), is frequently detected in SPECIES_9606_human blood.
28282128	In this study, the sensitive dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and molecular docking were used to investigate the activation of CHEMICAL__EHDPP to SPECIES_9606_human GENE_5468_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_gamma (GENE_5468_PPARG).
28282128	Results show that CHEMICAL__EHDPP exhibited stronger GENE_5468_PPARG activation (EC20: 2.04  M) than CHEMICAL_C005445_triphenyl_phosphate (CHEMICAL__TPhP) (EC20: 2.78  M).
28282128	CHEMICAL__EHDPP upregulated the gene expression of CHEMICAL__3b_hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3b-HSD1) in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D002822_placental_choriocarcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the lowest observable effective concentration was 10  M, lower than that of CHEMICAL__TPhP (20  M).
28282128	CHEMICAL__EHDPP significantly altered CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone secretion at a lower concentration (10  M) than that of CHEMICAL__TPhP (20  M), and both CHEMICAL__EHDPP and CHEMICAL__TPhP significantly promoted SPECIES_9606_human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production at 20  M. Furthermore, inactivation of GENE_5468_PPARG by either a pharmacological inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C457499_GW9662) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the change in CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone secretion and gene expression in the cells exposed to CHEMICAL__EHDPP, suggesting that the GENE_5468_PPARG signaling pathway plays a role in the upregulation of CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone by the two OPFRs.
28282128	This is the first report to show that OPFRs can alter the biosynthesis of CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone in the placenta, which could affect female reproduction and fetal development.
28283972	Hepatic transcriptomic responses in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and different fat diet.
28283972	Chronic exposure to inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic (iAs) or a high-fat diet (HFD) can produce DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28283972	However, effects of HFD on risk assessment of iAs in drinking water are unclear.
28283972	In this study, we examined how HFD and iAs interact to alter iAs-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice.
28283972	SPECIES_10090_Mice fed low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD were exposed to 3  mg/CHEMICAL__L_iAs or deionized water for 10  weeks.
28283972	Results showed that HFD changed intake and excretion of iAs by SPECIES_10090_mice.
28283972	Then, HFD increased the amount of iAs-induced hepatic DNA damage and amplified changes in pathways related to cell death and growth, signal transduction, lipid metabolism, and insulin signaling.
28283972	Compared to gene expression profiles caused by iAs alone or HFD alone, insulin signaling pathway might play important roles in the interactive effects of iAs and HFD.
28283972	Our data suggest that HFD increases sensitivity of SPECIES_10090_mice to iAs in drinking water, resulting in increased hepatotoxicity.
28283972	This study highlight that HFD might enhance the risk of iAs hepatotoxicity in iAs-polluted regions.
28283972	The diet should be considered during risk assessment of iAs in drinking water.
28284660	iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics discovering potential serum biomarkers in locoweed poisoned SPECIES_9986_rabbits.
28284660	Locoism threatens the sustainable development of animal husbandry in areas around the world with intensified desertification, especially in the western United States, western China, Canada, and Mexico, among other countries.
28284660	This study was conducted to discover potential serum biomarkers in locoweed-poisoned SPECIES_9986_rabbits and lay a foundation for early diagnosis of locoism.
28284660	We performed iTRAQ labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS), comparing locoweed-poisoned SPECIES_9986_rabbits and healthy controls.
28284660	A total of 78 differentially-expressed proteins (fold change  >  1.5 or  <  0.67) were identified in the locoweed-poisoned SPECIES_9986_rabbits compared to healthy controls.
28284660	We found that 57.70% of differentially-expressed proteins were functionally related, and through bioinformatics analysis, we were able to construct a network mainly in complement and coagulation cascades.
28284660	Significant differences in GENE_9986)_thrombospondin_4 (GENE_9986)_THBS4), GENE_9986)_kininogen_1 (GENE_9986)_KNG1), hemoglobin (GENE_9986)_HBB), and GENE_9986)_complement_factor_I (CFI) between locoweed poisoned animals and controls were found (P  <  0.05) and validated by western blotting.
28284660	These results suggested that locoweed could damage neurocytes, lower immunity, and form thrombi in SPECIES_9986_rabbits.
28284660	Our study proposes potential biomarkers for locoism diagnosis and also provides a new experimental basis to understand the pathogenesis of locoism.
28284726	Endocrine disrupting compounds modulates GENE_9370_adiponectin secretion, expression of its receptors and action on steroidogenesis in ovarian follicle.
28284726	We determined the effect of CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin-like CHEMICAL__polychlorinated_naphtalenes (CHEMICAL_D011285_PCN) (Halowax 1051) (100pg/ml), CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene [CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P] (2.5ng/ml), CHEMICAL_D006581_hexachlorobenzene (CHEMICAL_C049400_HCBz) (0.2ng/ml) and non-CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin like CHEMICAL__polybrominated_diphenyl_ether (CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE_47) (25ng/ml) and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) (20ng/ml) on ovarian GENE_9370_adiponectin secretion (ELISA) and its receptors expression (Western blot).
28284726	Ovarian cells co-culture was used to examine action of endocrine disruptors (EDCs) on GENE_9370_adiponectin (10 g/ml) stimulated steroidogenesis.
28284726	B(a)P, CHEMICAL_C049400_HCBz, CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone (T) decreased GENE_9370_adiponectin secretion and receptors expression, CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE_47, CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol (E2) had the opposite effect, while CHEMICAL_D011285_PCN had inhibitory effect only on GENE_9370_adiponectin secretion.
28284726	In GENE_9370_adiponectin stimulated cells CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin-like compounds decreased E2 and except of CHEMICAL_D011285_PCN had no effect on T, while non-CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin like increased E2 and decreased T secretion.
28284726	Results indicated to modulatory role of EDCs on GENE_9370_adiponectin and its receptor and its action on ovarian steroidogenesis, suggest that CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin- like compounds may contribute to the DISEASE_D010049_ovarian_dysfunction in DISEASE_D009765_obesity_related_disorders.
28284859	Molecular mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C023035_3_3_4_4_5_pentachlorobiphenyl-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma cells.
28284859	CHEMICAL_D011078_Polychlorinated_biphenyls (CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs) are classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
28284859	Many studies have found a positive association between the progression of DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC) and CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs exposure.
28284859	However, the influence of CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of DISEASE_D006528_HCC remains to be unclear.
28284859	In this study, we explored the effect of CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 on EMT in DISEASE_D006528_HCC cells and its underlying mechanisms.
28284859	The data showed that CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126, exposing both Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells for 48h, promoted EMT that was demonstrated by GENE_999_E_cadherin repression, up-regulation of GENE_1000_N_cadherin and GENE_7431_vimentin, and morphological alteration.
28284859	We found that GENE_6774_signal_transducer_and_activator_of_transcription_3 (GENE_6774_STAT3)/GENE_6615_Snail1 signaling was activated after CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 exposure, and the addition of GENE_6774_STAT3 inhibitor CHEMICAL_C519885_WP1066 blocked CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126-induced down-regulation of GENE_999_E_cadherin as well as up-regulation of GENE_1000_N_cadherin and GENE_7431_vimentin.
28284859	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 exposure increased GENE_5315_pyruvate_kinase_M2 (GENE_5315_PKM2) expression and its nuclear translocation, whereas treatment with GENE_5315_PKM2 shRNA suppressed the activation of GENE_6774_STAT3/GENE_6615_Snail1 signaling and the alternation of EMT-related molecules (GENE_999_E_cadherin, GENE_1000_N_cadherin and GENE_7431_vimentin).
28284859	Furthermore, this study indicated CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor (ER) and CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor (GENE_196_AhR) were involved in CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126-induced effects on GENE_5315_PKM2, GENE_6774_STAT3/GENE_6615_Snail1 signaling and EMT by according treatment using ER inhibitor ICI and GENE_196_AhR shRNA.
28284859	Notably, CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126-increased reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) production via GENE_196_AhR is associated with activation of GENE_5315_PKM2/GENE_6774_STAT3/GENE_6615_Snail1 cascades and contributes to EMT.
28284859	Taken together, these results indicated that CHEMICAL_C023035_PCB126 promotes EMT process of DISEASE_D006528_HCC cells via GENE_5315_PKM2/GENE_6774_STAT3/GENE_6615_Snail1 signaling which is mediated by ER and GENE_196_AhR.
28285151	GENE_196_Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor upregulates GENE_3553_IL_1b expression in hCMEC/D3 SPECIES_9606_human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells after CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure.
28285151	The GENE_196_AhR is a cytosolic ligand-dependent transcription factor activated by both endogenous and exogenous chemicals.
28285151	It can regulate expression of many target genes including some inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
28285151	To date GENE_196_AhR implication in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at SPECIES_9606_human cerebral endothelium has not been addressed.
28285151	In the present study, we investigated whether GENE_196_AhR could regulate the expression of two pro-inflammatory cytokines and one chemokine i.e.
28285151	GENE_3553_IL_1b, GENE_3569_IL_6 and GENE_3576_IL_8 in the hCMEC/D3 SPECIES_9606_human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line.
28285151	Exposure to CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD increased GENE_3553_IL_1b mRNA expression levels in hCMEC/D3.
28285151	By using small interfering RNA against GENE_196_AhR we demonstrated that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD effects on GENE_3553_IL_1b expression were mediated through GENE_196_AhR activation.
28285151	Regarding GENE_3569_IL_6 and GENE_3576_IL_8, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure had little or no effect on their mRNA levels in hCMEC/D3.
28285151	In conclusion, our findings suggest that GENE_196_AhR-mediated GENE_3553_IL_1b regulation in cerebral endothelium could induce BBB breakdown and contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of DISEASE_D009422_neurologic_disorders.
28285642	A new hope for DISEASE_D009765_obesity management: CHEMICAL_D001895_Boron inhibits adipogenesis in progenitor cells through the Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin pathway.
28285642	DISEASE_D009765_Obesity is a worldwide medical problem resulting in serious morbidity and mortality involving differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes (adipogenesis).
28285642	CHEMICAL_D001895_Boron treatment has been reported to be associated with DISEASE_D015431_weight_reduction in experimental animals; however, its effects on pre-adipocyte differentiation and anti-adipogenic molecular mechanisms are unknown.
28285642	In this study, we demonstrate the inhibitory activities of CHEMICAL_C032688_boric_acid (BA) and CHEMICAL__sodium_pentaborate_pentahydrate (CHEMICAL__NaB) on adipogenesis using common cellular models.
28285642	CHEMICAL_D001895_Boron treatment repressed the expression of adipogenesis-related genes and proteins, including CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein a and GENE_5468_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_y, by regulating critical growth factors and the GENE_1499_b_catenin, GENE_207_AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways.
28285642	In addition, although CHEMICAL_D001895_boron treatment did not induce apoptosis in pre-adipocytes, it depressed mitotic clonal expansion by regulation of cell cycle genes.
28285642	Overall, these data offer promising insights into the prevention/treatment of DISEASE_D009765_obesity and associated diseases.
28286118	Maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP) promotes the transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset reproductive dysfunctions through the female germline in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28286118	DISEASE_D004700_Endocrine_disruptors (DISEASE_D004700_EDs) are compounds known to promote transgenerational inheritance of DISEASE_D004194_adult_onset_disease in subsequent generations after maternal exposure during fetal gonadal development.
28286118	This study was designed to establish whether gestational and lactational exposure to the plasticizer CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP) at environmental doses promotes transgenerational effects on reproductive health in female offspring, as adults, over three generations in the SPECIES_10090_mouse.
28286118	Gestating F0 SPECIES_10090_mouse dams were exposed to 0, 0.05, 5mg/kg/day CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP in the diet from gestational day 0.5 until the end of lactation.
28286118	The incidence of DISEASE_D004194_adult_onset_disease in reproductive function was recorded in F1, F2 and F3 female offspring.
28286118	In adult F1 females, CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP exposure induced reproductive adverse effects with: i) altered ovarian follicular dynamics with reduced primordial follicular reserve and a larger growing pre-antral follicle population, suggesting accelerated follicular recruitment; ii) reduced oocyte quality and DISEASE_D002658_embryonic_developmental_competence; iii) dysregulation of the expression profile of a panel of selected ovarian and pre-implantation embryonic genes.
28286118	F2 and F3 female offspring displayed the same altered reproductive morphological phenotype and gene expression profiles as F1, thus showing transgenerational transmission of reproductive adverse effects along the female lineage.
28286118	These findings indicate that in SPECIES_10090_mice exposure to CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP at doses relevant to SPECIES_9606_human exposure during gonadal sex determination significantly perturbs the reproductive indices of female adult offspring and subsequent generations.
28286118	Evidence of transgenerational transmission has important implications for the reproductive health and fertility of animals and SPECIES_9606_humans, significantly increasing the potential biohazards of this toxicant.
28279692	Ovarian effects of prenatal exposure to CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene: Roles of embryonic and maternal CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione status.
28279692	Females deficient in the GENE_10090)_glutamate_cysteine_ligase_modifier_subunit_Gclm_ of the rate-limiting enzyme in CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione synthesis are more sensitive to ovarian follicle depletion and tumorigenesisby prenatal CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (GENE_10090)_BaP) exposure than GENE_10090)_Gclm+/+ SPECIES_10090_mice.
28279692	We investigated effects of prenatal exposure to GENE_10090)_BaP on reproductive development and ovarian mutations in Kras, a commonly mutated gene in epithelial DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_tumors.
28279692	Pregnantmice were dosed from gestational day 6.5 through 15.5 with 2mg/kg/day GENE_10090)_BaP or vehicle.
28279692	Puberty onset occurred 5 days earlier in F1 daughters of all GENE_10090)_Gclm genotypes exposed to GENE_10090)_BaP compared to controls.
28279692	GENE_10090)_Gclm+/- F1 daughters of GENE_10090)_Gclm+/- mothers and wildtype F1 daughters of wildtype mothers had similar depletion of ovarian follicles following prenatal exposure to GENE_10090)_BaP, suggesting that maternal GENE_10090)_Gclm genotype does not modify ovarian effects of prenatal GENE_10090)_BaP.
28279692	We observed no GENE_10090)_BaP treatment or GENE_10090)_Gclm genotype related differences in ovarian Kras codon 12 mutations in F1 offspring.
28280777	Quantifying Hormone Disruptors with an Engineered Bacterial Biosensor.
28280777	Endocrine disrupting compounds are found in increasing amounts in our environment, originating from pesticides, plasticizers, and pharmaceuticals, among other sources.
28280777	Although the full impact of these compounds is still under study, they have already been implicated in diseases such as DISEASE_D009765_obesity, DISEASE_D003920_diabetes, and DISEASE_D009369_cancer.
28280777	The list of chemicals that disrupt normal hormone function is growing at an alarming rate, making it crucially important to find sources of contamination and identify new compounds that display this ability.
28280777	However, there is currently no broad-spectrum, rapid test for these compounds, as they are difficult to monitor because of their high potency and chemical dissimilarity.
28280777	To address this, we have developed a new detection strategy for endocrine disrupting compounds that is both fast and portable, and it requires no specialized skills to perform.
28280777	This system is based on a native CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor construct expressed on the surface of SPECIES_562_Escherichia_coli, which enables both the detection of many detrimental compounds and signal amplification from impedance measurements due to the binding of bacteria to a modified electrode.
28280777	With this approach, sub-ppb levels of CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol and ppm levels of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A are detected in complex solutions.
28280777	Rather than responding to individual components, this system reports the total estrogenic activity of a sample using the most relevant biological receptor.
28280777	As an applied example, estrogenic chemicals released from a plastic baby bottle following microwave heating were detectable with this technique.
28280777	This approach should be broadly applicable to the detection of chemically diverse classes of compounds that bind to a single receptor.
28288859	DISEASE_D028361_Mitochondrial_toxicity of CHEMICAL_C076994_perfluorooctane_sulfonate in SPECIES_10090_mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
28288859	CHEMICAL_C076994_Perfluorooctane_sulfonate (CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS) is a persistent organic contaminant that may cause DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity in animals and SPECIES_9606_humans.
28288859	However, little is known about the underlying mechanism by which it affects the organelle DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in cardiomyocytes during the cardiogenesis.
28288859	Our previous proteomic study showed that differences of protein expression mainly existed in mitochondria of cardiomyocytes differentiated from embryonic stem (ES) cells after exposure to CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS.
28288859	Here, we focused on DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_toxicity of CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS in ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes.
28288859	The cardiomyogenesis from ES cells in vitro was inhibited, and the expression of L-type CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ channel (LTCC) was decreased to interrupt [CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_]c transient amplitude in cardiomyocytes after CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS treatment.
28288859	Transmission electron microscope revealed that swollen mitochondrion with vacuole in CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS-treated cells.
28288859	Meanwhile, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (    m) was declined and CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production was lowered.
28288859	These changes were related to the increased GENE_1956_EGFR phosphorylation, activated Rictor signaling, then mediated GENE_3099_HK2 binding to mitochondrial membrane.
28288859	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS reduced the interaction of GENE_3710_IP3R-GENE_3313_Grp75-VDAC and accumulated intracellular CHEMICAL_D005227_fatty_acids by activating Rictor, thereby attenuating GENE_10891_PGC_1a and GENE_9927_Mfn2 expressions, then destroying GENE_6445_mitochondria_associated_endoplasmic_reticulum_membrane (GENE_6445_MAM), which resulted in the decrease of [CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_]mito transient amplitude triggered by CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP.
28288859	In conclusion, mitochondrial structure damages and abnormal CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ shuttle were the important aspects in CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS-induced DISEASE_D064420_cardiomyocytes_toxicity from ES cells by activating Rictor signaling pathway.
28283350	Ultrafine CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon particles promote CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neuronal loss through activating microglial CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase.
28283350	BACKGROUND: Atmospheric ultrafine particles (UFPs) and pesticide CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone were considered as potential environmental risk factors for DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD).
28283350	However, whether and how UFPs alone and in combination with CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone affect the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D010300_PD remains largely unknown.
28283350	METHODS: CHEMICAL__Ultrafine_carbon_black (CHEMICAL__ufCB, a surrogate of UFPs) and CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone were used individually or in combination to determine their roles in chronic dopaminergic (DA) loss in neuron-glia, and neuron-enriched, mix-glia cultures.
28283350	Immunochemistry using antibody against CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine hydroxylase was performed to detect DA neuronal loss.
28283350	Measurement of extracellular CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide and intracellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) were performed to examine activation of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase.
28283350	Genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase and MAC-1 receptor in microglia were employed to examine their role in DA neuronal loss triggered by CHEMICAL__ufCB and CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone.
28283350	RESULTS: In rodent midbrain neuron-glia cultures, CHEMICAL__ufCB and CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone alone caused DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_death in a dose-dependent manner.
28283350	In particularly, CHEMICAL__ufCB at doses of 50 and 100 g/cm(2) induced significant loss of DA neurons.
28283350	More importantly, nontoxic doses of CHEMICAL__ufCB (10 g/cm(2)) and CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone (2nM) induced synergistic DISEASE_D064420_toxicity to DA neurons.
28283350	Microglial activation was essential in this process.
28283350	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide production from microglial CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase was critical in CHEMICAL__ufCB/CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28283350	Studies in mix-glia cultures showed that CHEMICAL__ufCB treatment activated microglial CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase to induce CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide production.
28283350	Firstly, CHEMICAL__ufCB enhanced the expression of CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase subunits (gp91(GENE_5341_phox), GENE_5341_p47_phox_ and GENE_3578_p40(GENE_5341_phox)); secondly, CHEMICAL__ufCB was recognized by microglial surface MAC-1 receptor and consequently promoted CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-induced GENE_5341_p47(GENE_5341_phox) and GENE_945_p67(GENE_5341_phox) translocation assembling active CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase.
28283350	CONCLUSION: CHEMICAL__ufCB and CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone worked in synergy to activate CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase in microglia, leading to oxidative damage to DA neurons.
28283350	Our findings delineated the potential role of ultrafine particles alone and in combination with pesticide CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28283413	CHEMICAL_C012037_Solasodine inhibits invasion of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer cell through downregulation of GENE_406991_miR_21 and MMPs expression.
28283413	CHEMICAL_C012037_Solasodine, a naturally occurring aglycone of glycoalkaloid in SPECIES_4111_eggplant (SPECIES_4111_Solanum_melongena), was found to inhibit proliferation in various DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells.
28283413	However, the effect of CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine on cancer cell metastasis remains unclear.
28283413	This study investigates the suppression mechanism of CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine on motility of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer cell A549 in  vitro.
28283413	Results show that CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine reduces viability of A549  cells.
28283413	Treatment with non-toxic doses of CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine suppresses markedly cell invasion.
28283413	CHEMICAL_C012037_Solasodine reduces the mRNA level of GENE_4313_matrix_metalloproteinase_2 (GENE_4313_MMP_2), GENE_4318_MMP_9 and extracellular inducer of matrix metalloproteinase (GENE_682_EMMPRIN), but increases the expression of GENE_8434_reversion_inducing_cysteine_rich_protein_with_kazal_motifs (GENE_8434_RECK), as well as GENE_7076_tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinase_1 (GENE_7076_TIMP_1) and GENE_7077_TIMP_2.
28283413	Immunoblotting assays indicate that CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine is effective in suppressing PI3K and Akt phosphorylation.
28283413	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine downregulates oncogenic GENE_406991_microRNA_21 (GENE_406991_miR_21), which has been known to target GENE_8434_RECK.
28283413	Downregulation of GENE_406991_miR_21 by GENE_406991_miR_21 inhibitor increases GENE_8434_RECK expression and decreases cell invasion, suggesting that downregulation of GENE_406991_miR_21 by CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine may contribute to elevate GENE_8434_RECK expression and subsequently inhibiting cell invasion.
28283413	Taken together, the results reveal that inhibition of A549  cell invasion by CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine may be, at least in part, through blocking MMP expression.
28283413	CHEMICAL_C012037_Solasodine also reduces PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and downregulates expression of GENE_406991_miR_21.
28283413	These findings demonstrate an attractive therapeutic potential for CHEMICAL_C012037_solasodine in DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer anti-metastatic therapy.
28286204	Long-term CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen treatment induced DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice and the involvement of GENE_10090)_Egr_1.
28286204	CHEMICAL_D000082_Acetaminophen (CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP)-induced DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury has already been well studied.
28286204	However, whether long-term administration of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP will cause DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis is still not very clear.
28286204	This study aims to investigate the DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice induced by long-term CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP treatment and the involvement of GENE_10090)_early_growth_response_1 (GENE_10090)_Egr_1).
28286204	SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6 SPECIES_10090_mice were orally given with CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP (200, 300mg/kg) for 2, 6 or 10 weeks, respectively.
28286204	Liver CHEMICAL_18095_hydroxyproline content, collagen deposition and inflammatory cells infiltration were increased in SPECIES_10090_mice treated with CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP (200, 300mg/kg) for 6 or 10 weeks.
28286204	Liver GENE_10090)_mRNA_expression_of_collagen_COL_1a1, GENE_1281_Col3a1, transforming growth factor-b (GENE_7040_TGF_b) and serum contents of GENE_3702)_COL1, GENE_3702)_COL3, GENE_7040_TGF_b were all increased in CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28286204	Liver expression of GENE_10090)_a_smooth_muscle_actin (GENE_10090)_a_SMA) and phosphorylated GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 and GENE_17126;17127_Smad2_3 were all increased in CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28286204	Furthermore, increased liver mRNA expression of GENE_10090)_Egr_1 and its subsequent nuclear translocation were found in CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28286204	GENE_10090)_Egr_1 knock-out SPECIES_10090_mice were further applied.
28286204	CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis was found to be more serious in GENE_10090)_Egr_1 knock-out SPECIES_10090_mice.
28286204	CHEMICAL_C028473_N_acetyl_p_benzoquinoneimine (CHEMICAL_C028473_NAPQI), the CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP hepatotoxic metabolite, increased cellular mRNA expression of GENE_58_a_SMA, GENE_1277_Col1a1, GENE_1281_Col3a1, GENE_7040_TGF_b, induced GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 and GENE_4087;4088_Smad2_3 phosphorylation and GENE_1958_Egr_1 nuclear translocation in hepatic stellate LX2 cells.
28286204	In conclusion, long-term administration of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP induced DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice, and GENE_10090)_Egr_1 was critically involved in this process.
28286204	This study points out a warning and reference for SPECIES_9606_patients with long-term CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP ingestion in clinic.
28286205	CHEMICAL_C025589_Ochratoxin_A induced premature senescence in SPECIES_9606_human renal proximal tubular cells.
28286205	CHEMICAL_C025589_Ochratoxin_A (CHEMICAL__OTA) has many nephrotoxic effects and is a promising compound for the study of nephrotoxicity.
28286205	SPECIES_9606_Human renal proximal tubular cells (HKC) are an important model for the study of renal reabsorption, renal physiology and pathology.
28286205	Since the induction of CHEMICAL__OTA in renal senescence is largely unknown, whether CHEMICAL__OTA can induce renal senescence, especially at a sublethal dose, and the mechanism of DISEASE_D064420_OTA_toxicity remain unclear.
28286205	In our study, a sublethal dose of CHEMICAL__OTA led to an enhanced senescent phenotype, b-galactosidase staining and senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
28286205	Cell cycle arrest and cell shape alternations also confirmed senescence.
28286205	In addition, telomere analysis by RT-qPCR allowed us to classify CHEMICAL__OTA-induced senescence as a premature senescence.
28286205	Western blot assays showed that the GENE_7157_p53-GENE_644914_p21 and the GENE_1029_p16-GENE_5925_pRB pathways and the ezrin-associated cell spreading changes were activated during the CHEMICAL__OTA-induced senescence of HKC.
28286205	In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CHEMICAL__OTA promotes the senescence of HKC through the GENE_7157_p53-GENE_644914_p21 and GENE_1029_p16-GENE_5925_pRB pathways.
28286205	The understanding of the mechanisms of CHEMICAL__OTA-induced senescence is critical in determining the role of CHEMICAL__OTA in DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and its potential carcinogenicity.
28300665	Grape seed extract ameliorates CHEMICAL_D001761_bleomycin-induced SPECIES_10090_mouse pulmonary fibrosis.
28300665	DISEASE_D011658_Pulmonary_fibrosis is common in a variety of DISEASE_D011014_inflammatory_lung_diseases, such as DISEASE_D017563_interstitial_pneumonia, DISEASE_D029424_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease, and DISEASE_D012829_silicosis.
28300665	There is currently no effective clinical drug treatment.
28300665	It has been reported that DISEASE_D009366_grape_seed_extracts (DISEASE_D009366_GSE) has extensive pharmacological effects with minimal DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28300665	Although it has been found that DISEASE_D009366_GSE can improve the lung collagen deposition and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis pathology induced by CHEMICAL_D001761_bleomycin in SPECIES_10116_rat, its effects on pulmonary function, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases and epithelial-mesenchymal transition remain to be researched.
28300665	In the present study, we studied whether DISEASE_D009366_GSE provided protection against CHEMICAL_D001761_bleomycin (CHEMICAL__BLM)-induced DISEASE_D011658_mouse_pulmonary_fibrosis.
28300665	ICR strain SPECIES_10090_mice were treated with CHEMICAL__BLM in order to establish DISEASE_D011658_pulmonary_fibrosis models.
28300665	DISEASE_D009366_GSE was given daily via intragastric administration for three weeks starting at one day after intratracheal instillation.
28300665	DISEASE_D009366_GSE at 50 or 100mg/kg significantly reduced CHEMICAL__BLM-induced inflammatory cells infiltration, proinflammatory factor protein expression, and CHEMICAL_18095_hydroxyproline in lung tissues, and improved pulmonary function in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28300665	Additionally, treatment with DISEASE_D009366_GSE also significantly impaired CHEMICAL__BLM-induced increases in lung fibrotic marker expression (GENE_10090)_collagen_type_I_alpha_1 and GENE_10090)_fibronectin_1) and decreases in an anti-fibrotic marker (GENE_10090)_E_cadherin).
28300665	Further investigation indicated that the possible molecular targets of DISEASE_D009366_GSE are matrix metalloproteinases-9 (GENE_10090)_MMP_9) and GENE_10090)_TGF_b1, given that treatment with DISEASE_D009366_GSE significantly prevented CHEMICAL__BLM-induced increases in GENE_10090)_MMP_9 and GENE_10090)_TGF_b1 expression in the lungs.
28300665	Together, these results suggest that supplementation with DISEASE_D009366_GSE may improve the quality of life of lung DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis SPECIES_9606_patients by inhibiting GENE_4318_MMP_9 and GENE_7040_TGF_b1 expression in the lungs.
28296042	CHEMICAL_C029938_Nickel_sulfate induced apoptosis via activating ROS-dependent mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in SPECIES_10116_rat Leydig cells.
28296042	CHEMICAL_D009532_Nickel can induce apoptosis of testicular Leydig cells in SPECIES_10090_mice, whereas the mechanisms remain unclear.
28296042	In this study, we investigated the role of CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-induced reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) mediated apoptosis pathways in SPECIES_10116_rat Leydig cells.
28296042	Fluorescent DCF and GENE_10116)_Annexin_V CHEMICAL_D016650_FITC/PI staining were performed to measure the production of ROS and apoptosis in Leydig cells.
28296042	RT-qPCR and Western blot were conducted to analyze the key genes and proteins involved in mitochondria and ERS apoptotic pathways.
28296042	The results showed that CHEMICAL_C029938_nickel_sulfate induced ROS generation, consequently resulted in nucleolus deformation and apoptosis in testicular Leydig cells, which were then attenuated by ROS inhibitors of CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) and CHEMICAL_32849_2_2_6_6_tetramethyl_1_piperidinyloxy (CHEMICAL_C003959_TEMPO).
28296042	CHEMICAL_C029938_Nickel_sulfate-triggered Leydig cells apoptosis via mitochondria and ERS pathways was characterized by the upregulated mRNA and proteins expression of GENE_10116)_Bak, cytochrome c, GENE_10116)_caspase_9, GENE_10116)_caspase_3, GENE_10116)_GRP78, GENE_10116)_GADD153, and GENE_10116)_caspase_12, which were inhibited by CHEMICAL__NAC and CHEMICAL_C003959_TEMPO respectively.
28296042	The findings indicated that CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-induced ROS generation was involved in apoptosis via mitochondria and ERS pathways in SPECIES_10116_rat Leydig cells.
28303633	CHEMICAL_C018021_Cobalt_chloride exposure dose-dependently induced hepatotoxicity through enhancement of GENE_10116)_cyclooxygenase_2 (COX-2)/B-cell associated protein X (GENE_10116)_BAX) signaling and genotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats.
28303633	CHEMICAL_C018021_Cobalt_chloride (CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 ) is one of the many environmental contaminants, used in numerous industrial sectors.
28303633	It is a pollutant with deadly toxicological consequences both in developing and developed countries.
28303633	We investigated toxicological impact of CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 on hepatic antioxidant status, apoptosis, and genotoxicity.
28303633	Forty SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were divided into four groups, 10 SPECIES_10116_rats per group: Group 1 served as control and received clean tap water orally; Group 2 received CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 solution (150 mg/L); Group 3 received CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 solution (300 mg/L); and Group 4 received CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 (600 mg/L) in drinking water for 7 days, respectively.
28303633	Exposure of SPECIES_10116_rats to CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 led to a significant decline in hepatic antioxidant enzymes together with significant increase in markers of oxidative stress.
28303633	Immunohistochemistry revealed dose-dependent increase in GENE_10116)_cyclooxygenase_2 and GENE_10116)_BAX expressions together with increased frequency of Micronucleated Polychromatic Erythrocytes.
28303633	Combining all, CHEMICAL_C018021_CoCl2 administration led to hepatic damage through induction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.
28300557	High-fat diet aggravates CHEMICAL_C511295_2_2_4_4_tetrabromodiphenyl_ether-inhibited CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production via GENE_10116)_DAX_1 in Leydig cells in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28300557	Growing evidence has revealed that a high-fat diet (HFD) could lead to disorders of glycolipid metabolism and insulin-resistant states, and HFDs have been associated with the inhibition of testicular steroidogenesis.
28300557	Our previous study demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C511295_2_2_4_4_tetrabromodiphenyl_ether (CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47) could increase the risk of DISEASE_D003920_diabetes in SPECIES_9606_humans and reduce CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28300557	However, whether the HFD affects CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47-inhibited CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production by elevating insulin levels and inducing related pathways remains unknown.
28300557	In male SPECIES_10116_rats treated with CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47 by gavage for 12 weeks, the HFD significantly increased the CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47 content of the liver and testis and increased the weight of the adipose tissue; increased DISEASE_D005234_macrovesicular_steatosis in the liver and the levels of CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides, fasting CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and insulin; further aggravated the disruption of the seminiferous epithelium; and lowered the level of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, resulting in fewer sperm in the epididymis.
28300557	Of note, the HFD enhanced CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47-induced GENE_10116)_DAX_1 expression and decreased the expression levels of StAR and 3b-HSD in the testicular interstitial compartments in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28300557	In isolated primary Leydig cells from SPECIES_10116_rats, CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47 or insulin increased GENE_10116)_DAX_1 expression, decreased the expression of StAR and 3b-HSD, and reduced CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production, which was nearly reversed by knocking down GENE_10116)_DAX_1.
28300557	These results indicated that the HFD aggravates CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47-inhibited CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production through DISEASE_D006946_hyperinsulinemia, and the accumulation of testicular CHEMICAL_C511295_BDE47 that induces the up-regulation of GENE_10116)_DAX_1 and the subsequent down-regulation of steroidogenic proteins, i.e., StAR and 3b-HSD, in Leydig cells.
28300664	Gene expression changes in immune response pathways following oral administration of CHEMICAL_C020806_tetrabromobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TBBPA) in female Wistar Han SPECIES_10116_rats.
28300664	CHEMICAL_C020806_Tetrabromobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TBBPA) is a brominated flame retardant used globally at high volumes, primarily in the CHEMICAL_30721_epoxy resin of circuit boards.
28300664	It has been detected in the environment and in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28300664	The National Toxicology Program found that chronic oral CHEMICAL__TBBPA treatment of 250mg/kg and higher caused an increased incidence of uterine lesions in female Wistar Han SPECIES_10116_rats.
28300664	The present laboratory has previously reported changes in gene expression associated with CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen homeostasis in liver and uterine tissue of adult female Wistar Han SPECIES_10116_rats after five days of gavage with 250mg/kg of CHEMICAL__TBBPA.
28300664	Microarray analysis of tissue from these same CHEMICAL__TBBPA-treated SPECIES_10116_rats was performed to detect additional pathways perturbed by CHEMICAL__TBBPA.
28300664	Microarray analysis of uterine tissue detected downregulation of genes in pathways of the immune response following CHEMICAL__TBBPA treatment.
28300664	These results, along with validation of associated gene expression changes using droplet digital PCR, are reported here.
28300664	Our findings suggest mechanisms that may be related to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-mediated immunosuppression.
28302478	Molecular mechanisms of CHEMICAL__discrotophos-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in HepG2 cells: The role of GENE_1161_CSA in oxidative stress.
28302478	Dicrotophos (Dic), an insecticide and acaricide, is used against a variety of sucking, boring and chewing pests.
28302478	It was proven that Dic induced oxidative DNA damage in HepG2 cells.
28302478	However, the molecular mechanisms of this compound were still unclear.
28302478	First of all, the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and oxidative DNA damage were confirmed.
28302478	Next, using RNA-seq for detecting differential expressed genes (DEGs) in cells treated with 50   M Dic for 24  h, we showed that the dysregulation of these genes, irrespective of up (1298 genes) or down (2125 genes) regulation, could be attributed to some diverse pathways/metabolisms using KEGG analysis, particularly in DNA damage responses (DDRs) such as oxidative phosphorylation, CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair and cell cycle arrest.
28302478	Validation of some randomly selected DDR genes confirmed RNA-seq results.
28302478	We further demonstrated that Dic induced ROS overproduction, the loss of mitochondrial depolarization and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase.
28302478	In addition, we also definitely clarified the role of GENE_1161_CSA, a CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair enzymes in Dic-treated cells.
28302478	Collectively, our results showed that various mechanisms of Dic-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in HepG2 cells including downregulation of some genes related to CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair including GENE_1161_CSA and increased oxidative stress.
28302560	CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_Tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) induces hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis in C57BL6 SPECIES_10090_mouse via activating GENE_10090)_Akt and NF-kB signaling pathways.
28302560	CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) is a widespread environmental pollutant that could induce serious toxic effects in both SPECIES_9606_humans and rodents.
28302560	Some studies suggested that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure may facilitate the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28302560	However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which environmental pollutants promote DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury remains poorly understood.
28302560	In the present study, we established an animal model of CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure by intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD in male C57BL/6J SPECIES_10090_mice.
28302560	As revealed by Sirius red staining and CHEMICAL_D006416_hematoxylin-CHEMICAL_D004801_eosin (H_E) staining evaluation, we found that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice showed extensive DISEASE_D008107_disruption_of_liver_architecture, including hepatocellular DISEASE_D009336_necrosis, DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory_cell_infiltration, and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28302560	Furthermore, we showed that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD up-regulated the expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines GENE_10090)_tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha (GENE_10090)_TNF_a) and GENE_10090)_interleukin_6 (GENE_10090)_IL_6) in a dose-dependent manner in cultured HSCs.
28302560	The effects of CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD on cytokine secretion were very likely mediated by protein kinase B/GENE_10090)_Akt and Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathways, as indicated by the fact that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD markedly increased GENE_10090)_Akt phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kB GENE_10090)_p65 in HSCs.
28302560	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002, an GENE_10090)_Akt inhibitor, significantly attenuated CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-triggered HSC activation through blocking GENE_10090)_Akt phosphorylation and NF-kB activation.
28302560	These results indicate that HSCs are susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD and chronic CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD exposure may contribute to DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis by activating HSC GENE_10090)_Akt and NF-kB signaling pathways.
28315356	The effect of angiotensin receptor GENE_4311_neprilysin inhibitor, CHEMICAL__sacubitril/CHEMICAL_C081489_valsartan, on central nervous system amyloid-b concentrations and clearance in the SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkey.
28315356	CHEMICAL__Sacubitril/CHEMICAL_C081489_valsartan (CHEMICAL_C549068_LCZ696) is the first angiotensin receptor GENE_4311_neprilysin inhibitor approved to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D006333_heart_failure with reduced ejection fraction.
28315356	As GENE_4311_neprilysin (NEP) is one of several enzymes known to degrade amyloid-b (Ab), there is a theoretical risk of Ab accumulation following long-term NEP inhibition.
28315356	The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of CHEMICAL__sacubitril/CHEMICAL_C081489_valsartan on central nervous system clearance of Ab isoforms in SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkeys using the sensitive Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK   )-Ab methodology.
28315356	The in vitro selectivity of CHEMICAL_C081489_valsartan, CHEMICAL__sacubitril, and its active metabolite sacubitrilat was established; CHEMICAL__sacubitrilat did not inhibit other SPECIES_9606_human Ab-degrading metalloproteases.
28315356	In a 2-week study, CHEMICAL__sacubitril/CHEMICAL_C081489_valsartan (50mg/kg/day) or vehicle was orally administered to female SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkeys in conjunction with SILK   -Ab.
28315356	Despite low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain penetration, CSF exposure to CHEMICAL__sacubitril was sufficient to inhibit NEP and resulted in an increase in the elimination half-life of Ab1-42 (65.3%; p=0.026), Ab1-40 (35.2%; p=0.04) and Abtotal (29.8%; p=0.04) acutely; this returned to normal as expected with repeated dosing for 15days.
28315356	CSF concentrations of newly generated Ab (AUC(0-24h)) indicated elevations in the more aggregable form Ab1-42 on day 1 (20.4%; p=0.039) and day 15 (34.7%; p=0.0003) and in shorter forms Ab1-40 (23.4%; p=0.009), Ab1-38 (64.1%; p=0.0001) and Abtotal (50.45%; p=0.00002) on day 15.
28315356	However, there were no elevations in any Ab isoforms in the brains of these monkeys on day 16.
28315356	In a second study SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkeys were administered CHEMICAL__sacubitril/CHEMICAL_C081489_valsartan (300mg/kg) or vehicle control for 39weeks; no microscopic brain changes or Ab deposition, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining, were present.
28315356	Further clinical studies are planned to address the relevance of these findings.
28315714	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium-induced DISEASE_D008107_malignant_transformation_of_rat_liver cells: Potential key role and regulatory mechanism of altered GENE_10116)_apolipoprotein_E expression in enhanced invasiveness.
28315714	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium is a transition metal that is classified as SPECIES_9606_human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on DISEASE_D009369_Cancer (IARC) with multiple target sites.
28315714	Many studies using various model systems provide evidence of CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-induced DISEASE_D009369_malignancy formation in vivo or malignant cell transformation in vitro.
28315714	Nonetheless, further studies are needed to completely understand the mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium carcinogenicity.
28315714	Our prior studies have utilized a SPECIES_10116_rat liver epithelial cell line (TRL 1215) as a model for CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-induced malignant transformation.
28315714	In the present study, we focused on the molecular mechanisms of this malignant transformation, especially with regard to hyper-invasiveness stimulated by CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium transformation.
28315714	By performing a series of biochemical analyses on CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium transformed cells, it was determined that CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium had significantly down-regulated the expression of GENE_348_apolipoprotein_E (GENE_348_ApoE).
28315714	GENE_348_ApoE was recently established as a suppressor of cell invasion.
28315714	A key factor in the suppression of GENE_348_ApoE by CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium appeared to be that the metal evoked a CHEMICAL_C014347_5_aza_2_deoxycytidine-sensitive hypermethylation of the regulatory region of GENE_348_ApoE, coupled with interference of the action of GENE_10062_liver_X_receptor_a (GENE_10062_LXRa), a transcriptional regulator for GENE_348_ApoE.
28315714	Furthermore, the expression of GENE_10062_LXRa itself was suppressed by CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-mediated epigenetic modification.
28315714	Re-expression of GENE_348_ApoE clearly abrogated the cell invasion stimulated by CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-induced malignant transformation.
28315714	Together, the current results suggest that the CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-mediated enhanced cell invasion is linked to down-regulation of GENE_348_ApoE during malignant transformation these liver cells.
28315715	GENE_9467_Sab mediates DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction involved in CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate-induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity.
28315715	CHEMICAL_C097613_Imatinib_mesylate is an effective treatment for DISEASE_D015464_chronic_myelogenous_leukemia and DISEASE_D046152_gastrointestinal_stromal_tumors.
28315715	Although CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate is highly tolerable, it has been implicated in severe DISEASE_D006333_congestive_heart_failure in SPECIES_10090_mouse models and SPECIES_9606_patients.
28315715	A hallmark of CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate-induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity is DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction.
28315715	The mitochondrial scaffold GENE_9467_Sab has been implicated in facilitating signaling responsible for DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction in a GENE_5599_c_Jun_N_terminal_Kinase (GENE_5599_JNK)-dependent manner.
28315715	We examined the impact of GENE_10116)_Sab-mediated signaling on CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib mesylate DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity in H9c2 SPECIES_10116_rat cardiomyocyte-like cells.
28315715	Silencing GENE_9467_Sab increased the LD50 of CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate 4-fold in H9c2 cells.
28315715	Disrupting GENE_9467_Sab-mediated signaling prevented CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate-induced apoptosis as well.
28315715	Knockdown of GENE_9467_Sab or inhibition with a small peptide prevented oxidative stress, which was indicated by decreased reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.
28315715	Further, inhibition of GENE_9467_Sab-related signaling partially rescued deficits in mitochondrial respiration, CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production, and membrane potential in CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib mesylate-treated H9c2 cells.
28315715	Conversely, over-expression of GENE_9467_Sab in H9c2 cells increased the DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity of CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate in vitro decreasing the LD50 over 4-fold.
28315715	GENE_9467_Sab expression was induced in H9c2 cells following cardiovascular-like stress in an AP-1 dependent manner.
28315715	These data demonstrate that CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib_mesylate influences mitochondrial signaling leading to DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction and DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity.
28315776	Cleistocalyx nervosum var.
28315776	paniala berry fruit protects DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.
28315776	Oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses cause DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_damage leading to DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disorders.
28315776	Cleistocalyx nervosum var.
28315776	paniala (CNP) berry fruit has been shown to possess powerful antioxidant properties.
28315776	Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of CNP extract against CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate-mediated oxidative/ER stress-induced cell death in SPECIES_10090_mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22  cells.
28315776	CNP extract was clarified for its radical scavenging activities, total CHEMICAL__phenolic and CHEMICAL_D000872_anthocyanin contents.
28315776	The key CHEMICAL__anthocyanin_cyanidin_3_glucoside was used as a marker to standardize the extract used in the study.
28315776	We found that pretreated cells with CNP extract (0.05-1   g/ml) prevented neuronal cell death in response to 5  mM CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate evaluated by cell viability CHEMICAL_53233_MTT, LDH and apoptosis/DISEASE_D009336_necrosis GENE_10090)_Annexin_V/CHEMICAL_D011419_propidium_iodide co-staining assays.
28315776	For mechanistic approach, CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate-induced cell death through reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS)-mediated ER stress pathways, indicating the increase of ROS and ER stress signature molecules including calpain, caspases-12 and GENE_10090)_C_EBP_homologous_proteins (GENE_10090)_CHOP).
28315776	CNP extract inhibited ROS production.
28315776	Moreover, the extract also suppressed the specific-ER stress apoptotic proteins level in CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate-induced cells by upregulating the gene expression of cellular antioxidant enzymes (SODs, CAT, GPx and GENE_10090)_GSTs).
28315776	Taken together, our results provide information about and the molecular mechanism of CNP extract as a promising neuroprotectant and antioxidant.
28316773	CHEMICAL_D014807_Vitamin_D treatment during pregnancy prevents autism-related phenotypes in a mouse model of maternal immune activation.
28316773	BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to infection is a recognized environmental risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders of developmental origins such as autism or schizophrenia.
28316773	Experimental work in animals indicates that this link is mediated by maternal immune activation (MIA) involving interactions between cytokine-associated inflammatory events, oxidative stress, and other pathophysiological processes such as hypoferremia and CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc deficiency.
28316773	Maternal administration of the viral mimic CHEMICAL__polyriboinosinic_polyribocytidylic_acid (poly(I:C)) in mice produces several behavioral phenotypes in adult offspring of relevance to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
28316773	METHODS: Here, we investigated whether some of these phenotypes might also present in juveniles.
28316773	In addition, given the known immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D, we also investigated whether the co-administration of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D could block MIA-induced ASD-related behaviors.
28316773	We co-administered the hormonally active form of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D, CHEMICAL__1a_25_dihydroxy_vitamin_D3 (CHEMICAL__1_25OHD), simultaneously with poly(I:C) and examined (i) social interaction, stereotyped behavior, emotional learning and memory, and innate anxiety-like behavior in juveniles and (ii) the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a in maternal plasma and fetal brains.
28316773	RESULTS: We show that like adult offspring that were exposed to MIA, juveniles display similar deficits in social approach behavior.
28316773	Juvenile MIA offspring also show abnormal stereotyped digging and impaired acquisition and expression of tone-cued fear conditioning.
28316773	Importantly, our study reveals that prenatal administration of CHEMICAL__1_25OHD abolishes all these behavioral deficits in poly(I:C)-treated juveniles.
28316773	However, prenatal administration of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D had no effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in dams or in fetal brains suggesting the anti-inflammatory actions of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D are not the critical mechanism for its preventive actions in this ASD animal model.
28316773	CONCLUSIONS: This work raises the possibility that early dietary supplementation with CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D may open new avenues for a successful attenuation or even prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders following maternal inflammation during pregnancy.
28318385	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic-induced sumoylation of GENE_80198_Mus81 is involved in regulating genomic stability.
28318385	Chronic environmental exposure to metal toxicants such as CHEMICAL_D002857_chromium and CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic is closely related to the development of several types of common DISEASE_D009369_cancers.
28318385	Genetic and epigenetic studies in the past decade reveal that post-translational modifications of histones play a role in DISEASE_D063646_metal_carcinogenesis.
28318385	However, exact molecular mechanisms of DISEASE_D063646_metal_carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated.
28318385	In this study we found that CHEMICAL__As_sub_2_sub_O_sub_3_sub_, an environmental metal toxicant, upregulated overall modifications of many cellular proteins by GENE_6613;6612_SUMO2_3.
28318385	Sumoylated proteins from CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-treated cells constitutively expressing His<sub>6</sub>-GENE_6613_SUMO2 were pulled down by CHEMICAL__Ni-IDA resin under denaturing conditions.
28318385	Mass spectrometric analysis revealed over 100 proteins that were potentially modified by sumoylation.
28318385	GENE_80198_Mus81, a DNA endonuclease involved in homologous recombination repair, was among the identified proteins whose sumoylation was increased after treatment with As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3.</sub>We further showed that GENE_3858_K10 and K524 were 2 CHEMICAL_25094_lysine residues essential for GENE_80198_Mus81 sumoylation.
28318385	Moreover, we demonstrated that GENE_80198_Mus81 sumoylation is important for normal mitotic chromosome congression and that cells expressing SUMO-resistant GENE_80198_Mus81 mutants displayed compromised DNA damage responses after exposure to metal toxins such as CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ and CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic.
28314734	GENE_64778_FNDC3B is another novel partner fused to GENE_5914_RARA in the t(3;17)(q26;q21) variant of DISEASE_D015473_acute_promyelocytic_leukemia.
28315333	CHEMICAL_D014284_Triiodothyronine promotes the proliferation of epicardial progenitor cells through the MAPK/ERK pathway.
28315333	Thyroid hormone has important functions in the development and physiological function of the heart.
28315333	The aim of this study was to determine whether CHEMICAL_18258_3_5_3_Triiodothyronine (T3) can promote the proliferation of epicardial progenitor cells (EPCs) and to investigate the potential underlying mechanism.
28315333	Our results showed that T3 significantly promoted the proliferation of EPCs in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
28315333	The thyroid hormone nuclear receptor inhibitor CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (100   mol/L) did not affect T3's ability to induce proliferation.
28315333	Further studies showed that the mRNA expression levels of GENE_5594_mitogen_activated_protein_kinase_1 (GENE_5594_MAPK1), GENE_5595_MAPK3, and Ki67 in EPCs in the T3 group (10  nmol/L) increased 2.9-, 3-, and 4.1-fold, respectively, compared with those in the control group (P  <  0.05).
28315333	In addition, the mRNA expression of the cell cycle protein GENE_595_cyclin_D1 in the T3 group increased approximately 2-fold compared with the control group (P  <  0.05), and there were more EPCs in the S phase of the cell cycle (20.6% vs. 12.0%, P  <  0.05).
28315333	The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway inhibitor CHEMICAL_C113580_U0126 (10   mol/L) significantly inhibited the ability of T3 to promote the proliferation of EPCs and to alter cell cycle progression.
28315333	This study suggested that T3 significantly promotes the proliferation of EPCs, and this effect may be achieved through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.
28321046	SPECIES_4097_Tobacco CHEMICAL_35803_nitrosamine CHEMICAL__NNK increases ALDH-positive cells via ROS-Wnt signaling pathway in A549 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer cells.
28321046	Epidemiological studies suggest that DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer, which is a major cause of DISEASE_D009369_cancer_death, has a critical association with cigarette smoking.
28321046	SPECIES_4097_Tobacco-specific CHEMICAL__nitrosamine_4_methylnitrosamino_1_3_pyridyl_1_butanone (CHEMICAL__NNK) in cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28321046	However, the mechanisms by which CHEMICAL__NNK promotes DISEASE_D009369_cancer development have not been fully elucidated.
28321046	Growing evidence suggests that DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer originates from DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are a minor population of DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer cells.
28321046	In the present study, we investigated the effects of CHEMICAL__NNK on the CSCs in A549 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer cells using flow cytometry with CHEMICAL_D000079_aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a functional marker of CSCs.
28321046	We found that CHEMICAL__NNK increased the proportion of ALDH-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner.
28321046	A Wnt inhibitor CHEMICAL__PNU74654 reduced CHEMICAL__NNK-induced expression levels of Wnt target gene GENE_22943_Dkk1 and increase in ALDH-positive cells.
28321046	We next examined the signaling pathway that mediates the CHEMICAL__NNK-induced increase in ALDH-positive cells via Wnt signaling.
28321046	CHEMICAL__DCF assay revealed that CHEMICAL__NNK induced reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) production.
28321046	The ROS scavenger CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) inhibited the CHEMICAL__NNK-induced Wnt activation and increase in ALDH-positive cells.
28321046	These data suggest that CHEMICAL__NNK-induced ROS activate the Wnt signaling pathway in A549 cells.
28321046	These findings would provide new insights into the role of CHEMICAL__NNK in the lung CSCs.
28322778	Down-regulation of GENE_1019_cyclin_dependent_kinase_4 and MAPK through CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor mediated cell cycle arrest in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer induced by gold nanoparticle tagged toxin protein CHEMICAL__NKCT1.
28322778	AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether gold nanoparticles conjugated cytotoxic protein CHEMICAL__NKCT1 (GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1) acted through the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor mediated pathway in MCF-7  cells and to establish the MAPK and GENE_5293_PI3k/GENE_207_Akt signal transduction pathway.
28322778	METHODS: Apoptosis was done by flow cytometry.
28322778	BrdU incorporation and nuclear proliferating antigen was measured by flow cytometry.
28322778	Wound healing assay along with matrigel chamber invasion and migration was done.
28322778	Expression of GENE_4318_MMP9 was checked by flow cytometry and also by gelatin zymography.
28322778	To analyze the regulation of signaling protein, western blot was done.
28322778	CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay was done to evaluate the ligand receptor pathway using the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) for inhibitor effects.
28322778	RESULTS: Treatment of GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1 (3.9   g/ml) exhibited 38.04% early apoptosis and 4.29% late apoptotic cell.
28322778	GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1 significantly inhibited both cell migration and invasion with suppressed expression of GENE_4318_MMP9.
28322778	In addition, treatment of cultured SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer MCF7 cells with CHEMICAL__GNP_NKCT1 reversely suppressed the incorporation of CHEMICAL_D001973_BrdU, with reduced expression of Ki-67.
28322778	The western blot analysis showed that GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1 arrested cell cycle progression through upregulation of the kinase inhibitor protein GENE_1026_p21 and inactivation of G1-cylin dependent kinase (GENE_1019_CDK4).
28322778	GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1 suppressed nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and also abrogated the phosphorylation of GENE_1432_p38_mitogen_activated_protein_kinase (MAPK), GENE_5293_phosphatidylinositide_3_kinase (GENE_5293_PI3k), GENE_207_Akt and extracellular regulated kinase (GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2).
28322778	CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay indicated that GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1 reduced proliferation in the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor induced ER negative DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231).
28322778	Addition of, ER inhibitor (CHEMICAL_D013629_tamoxifen) and GENE_5293_PI3K inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C009687_wortmannin) to cells resulted in reduced expression of Ki-67 and GENE_4318_MMP_9.
28322778	CONCLUSION: The data suggested that GNP-CHEMICAL__NKCT1 induced MCF7 cell inhibition may occur through CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor pathway via inactivation of GENE_1019_CDK4 and inactivation of GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt, GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 and GENE_5594_p38 MAPK signaling pathway with inhibitory effects on NF-kB, reducing the activity of GENE_4318_MMP9.
28322778	This result provides a new mechanism to explain the role of gold nanoparticles conjugated CHEMICAL__NKCT1 as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MCF7 cells.
28319090	A single-copy Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis screen identifies new GENE_10090)_PTEN-cooperating DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor genes.
28319090	The overwhelming number of genetic alterations identified through DISEASE_D009369_cancer genome sequencing requires complementary approaches to interpret their significance and interactions.
28319090	Here we developed a novel whole-body insertional mutagenesis screen in SPECIES_10090_mice, which was designed for the discovery of GENE_10090)_Pten-cooperating DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressors.
28319090	Toward this aim, we coupled mobilization of a single-copy inactivating Sleeping Beauty transposon to GENE_10090)_Pten disruption within the same genome.
28319090	The analysis of 278 transposition-induced prostate, DISEASE_D001943_breast_and_skin_tumors detected tissue-specific and shared data sets of known and candidate genes involved in DISEASE_D009369_cancer.
28319090	We validated GENE_10090)_ZBTB20, GENE_10090)_CELF2, GENE_10090)_PARD3, GENE_10090)_AKAP13 and WAC, which were identified by our screens in DISEASE_D009369_multiple_cancer types, as new DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor genes in DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer.
28319090	We demonstrated their synergy with GENE_10090)_PTEN in preventing invasion in vitro and confirmed their clinical relevance.
28319090	Further characterization of Wac in vivo showed obligate haploinsufficiency for this gene (which encodes an autophagy-regulating factor) in a GENE_10090)_Pten-deficient context.
28319090	Our study identified complex GENE_10090)_PTEN-cooperating DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor networks in different DISEASE_D009369_cancer_types, with potential clinical implications.
28323900	Long-term exposure to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy potentially through epigenetic mechanism in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28323900	Chemotherapy is the most common clinical option for treatment of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28323900	However, the efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the age of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer SPECIES_9606_patients.
28323900	Breast tissues are CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen responsive and the levels of ovarian CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen vary among the DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer SPECIES_9606_patients primarily between pre- and post-menopausal age.
28323900	Whether this age-dependent variation in CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen levels influences the chemotherapeutic efficacy in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer SPECIES_9606_patients is not known.
28323900	Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of natural CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen CHEMICAL_D004958_17_beta_estradiol (E2) on the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28323900	CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen responsive MCF-7 and T47D DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells were long-term exposed to 100 pg/ml CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen, and using these cells the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin and CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin were determined.
28323900	The result of cell viability and cell cycle analysis revealed increased sensitivities of CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin and CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin in CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-exposed MCF-7 and T47D cells as compared to their respective control cells.
28323900	Gene expression analysis of cell cycle, anti-apoptosis, DNA repair, and drug transporter genes further confirmed the increased efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-exposed cells at molecular level.
28323900	To further understand the role of epigenetic mechanism in enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy by CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen, cells were pre-treated with epigenetic drugs, CHEMICAL_C014347_5_aza_2_deoxycytidine and CHEMICAL_C012589_Trichostatin_A prior to CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin and CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin treatments.
28323900	The CHEMICAL_C014347_5_aza_2_deoxycytidine pre-treatment significantly decreased the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-induced efficacy of CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin and CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin, suggesting the role of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-induced hypermethylation in enhanced sensitivity of these drugs in CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-exposed cells.
28323900	In summary, the results of this study revealed that sensitivity to chemotherapy depends on the levels of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28323900	Findings of this study will have clinical implications in selecting the chemotherapy strategies for treatment of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer SPECIES_9606_patients depending on the serum CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen levels that varies among pre- and post-menopausal age of the SPECIES_9606_patients.
28324061	CHEMICAL_D011374_Progesterone Protects Against CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A-Induced DISEASE_D001145_Arrhythmias in Female SPECIES_10116_Rat Cardiac Myocytes via Rapid Signaling.
28324061	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is an estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that has a range of potential adverse health effects.
28324061	Previously we showed that acute exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA promoted DISEASE_D001145_arrhythmias in female SPECIES_10116_rat hearts through CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor rapid signaling.
28324061	CHEMICAL_D011374_Progesterone (P4) and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen have antagonistic or complementary actions in a number of tissues and systems.
28324061	In the current study, we examined the influence and possible protective effect of P4 on the rapid cardiac actions of CHEMICAL__BPA in female SPECIES_10116_rat cardiac myocytes.
28324061	Preincubation with physiological concentration (1 nM) of P4 abolished CHEMICAL__BPA-induced triggered activities in female cardiac myocytes.
28324061	Further, P4 abrogated CHEMICAL__BPA-induced alterations in CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ handling, including elevated sarcoplasmic reticulum CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ leak and CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ load.
28324061	Key to the inhibitory effect of P4 is its blockade of CHEMICAL__BPA-induced increase in the phosphorylation of phospholamban.
28324061	At myocyte and protein levels, these inhibitory actions of P4 were blocked by pretreatment with the nuclear P4 receptor (GENE_10116)_nPR) antagonist CHEMICAL_D015735_RU486.
28324061	Analysis using membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated P4 suggested that the actions of P4 were mediated by membrane-initiated signaling.
28324061	Inhibitory G (Gi) protein and phophoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), but not CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine protein kinase activation, were involved in the observed effects of P4.
28324061	In conclusion, P4 exerts an acute protective effect against CHEMICAL__BPA-induced arrhythmogenesis in female cardiac myocytes through GENE_10116)_nPR and the CHEMICAL__Gi/PI3K signaling pathway.
28324061	Our findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of EDCs in the context of native hormonals and may provide potential therapeutic strategies for protection against the cardiac DISEASE_D064420_toxicities associated with CHEMICAL__BPA exposure.
28329817	Early-Life CHEMICAL_D001564_Benzo_a_Pyrene Exposure Causes DISEASE_D019636_Neurodegenerative_Syndromes in Adult SPECIES_7955_Zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) and the Mechanism Involved.
28329817	There is increasing recognition of the importance of early-life environmental exposures in health disorders at later-life stages.
28329817	The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early-life exposure to CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (CHEMICAL_29022_BaP) could induce DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_syndromes at later-life stages in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28329817	Embryos were exposed to CHEMICAL_29022_BaP at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50   nM from early embryogenesis to 96   h post-fertilization (hpf), then transferred to clean water and maintained for 365 days.
28329817	We found that CHEMICAL_29022_BaP decreased locomotor and DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_ability, neurotransmitter levels of CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine, CHEMICAL_D015102_3_4_dihydroxyphenylacetic_acid and CHEMICAL_D009638_norepinephrine; and induced DISEASE_D009410_loss_of_dopaminergic_neurons and resulted in DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration.
28329817	Additionally, CHEMICAL_29022_BaP increased amyloid b protein and cell apoptosis in the adult SPECIES_7955_zebrafish brain.
28329817	Further, GENE_7955)_DNA_methyltransferase_1 (GENE_7955)_DNMT1) and DNMT3a were up-regulated in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain.
28329817	MeDIP-sequencing data of the 96 hpf larvae identified 235 differentially methylated genes in promoter, with the fold change   >   1.5.
28329817	GENE_7955)_Guanylate_cyclase_2F (GENE_7955)_gucy2f) and GENE_7955)_dopamine_receptor_D4_related_sequence (GENE_7955)_drd4_rs) were hypermethylation promoters, whereas CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc finger C4H2 domain (zc4h2) was a hypomethylation promoter in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain.
28329817	The mRNA levels of GENE_7955)_gucy2f and GENE_7955)_drd4_rs were down-regulated, and zc4h2 was up-regulated.
28329817	Our findings suggested that the lasting modifications of DNA methylation were associated with DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_syndromes in adult SPECIES_7955_zebrafish as a result of early-life CHEMICAL_29022_BaP exposure.
28329830	Secondhand Smoke-Prevalent Polycyclic CHEMICAL__Aromatic_Hydrocarbon Binary Mixture-Induced Specific Mitogenic and Pro-inflammatory Cell Signaling Events in Lung Epithelial Cells.
28329830	Low molecular weight CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons (LMW CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs; <   206.3   g/mol) are prevalent and ubiquitous environmental contaminants, presenting a SPECIES_9606_human health concern, and have not been as thoroughly studied as the high MW CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs.
28329830	LMW CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs exert their pulmonary effects, in part, through GENE_5594_P38-dependent and -independent mechanisms involving cell-cell communication and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators known to contribute to DISEASE_D008171_lung_disease.
28329830	Specifically, we determined the effects of two representative LMW CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs, CHEMICAL_C051246_1_methylanthracene (CHEMICAL__1_MeA) and CHEMICAL_C007738_fluoranthene (CHEMICAL__Flthn), individually and as a binary CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixture on the dysregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and GENE_10090)_connexin_43 (GENE_10090)_Cx43), activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), and induction of inflammatory mediators in a SPECIES_10090_mouse non-tumorigenic alveolar type II cell line (C10).
28329830	Both CHEMICAL__1_MeA, CHEMICAL__Flthn, and the binary CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixture of CHEMICAL__1_MeA and CHEMICAL__Flthn dysregulated GJIC in a dose and time-dependent manner, reduced GENE_2697_Cx43 protein, and activated the following MAPKs: GENE_5594_P38, GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2, and GENE_5599_JNK.
28329830	Inhibition of GENE_5594_P38 MAPK prevented DISEASE_D010661_PAH_induced_dysregulation of GJIC, whereas inhibiting ERK and GENE_5599_JNK did not prevent these CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs from dysregulating GJIC indicating a GENE_5594_P38-dependent mechanism.
28329830	A toxicogenomic approach revealed significant GENE_5594_P38-dependent and -independent pathways involved in DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid synthesis, metabolism, and oxidative responses.
28329830	Genes in these pathways were significantly altered by the binary CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixture when compared with CHEMICAL__1_MeA and CHEMICAL__Flthn alone suggesting interactive effects.
28329830	Exposure to the binary CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixture induced the production and release of cytokines and metalloproteinases from the C10 cells.
28329830	Our findings with a binary mixture of CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs suggest that combinations of LMW CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs may elicit synergistic or additive inflammatory responses which warrant further investigation and confirmation.
28329851	Short Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin Attenuates CHEMICAL_D014051_Toluene_Diisocyanate-induced DISEASE_D007249_Airway_Inflammation and Inhibits GENE_10090)_High_Mobility_Group_Box_1-GENE_10090)_Receptor_for_Advanced_Glycation_End_Products and Long Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin Expression.
28329851	Short thymic stromal lymphopoietin (short GENE_10090)_TSLP), one of GENE_10090)_TSLP variants, exerts anti-inflammatory activities in endotoxin shock and DISEASE_D003092_colitis SPECIES_10090_mouse models.
28329851	Our latest work reported that short GENE_85480_TSLP prevented house dust mite-induced epithelial barrier disruption.
28329851	Yet the role of short GENE_85480_TSLP in CHEMICAL_D014051_toluene_diisocyanate (CHEMICAL_53557_TDI)-induced DISEASE_D001249_asthma is unknown.
28329851	SPECIES_9606_Male SPECIES_10090_BALB_c SPECIES_10090_mice were sensitized and challenged with CHEMICAL_53557_TDI to generate a chemical-induced DISEASE_D001249_asthma model.
28329851	Synthetic short GENE_85480_TSLP peptides were given intranasally or intraperitoneally before each challenge.
28329851	CHEMICAL_53557_TDI significantly increased DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of airway, which were suppressed by short GENE_85480_TSLP treatment.
28329851	Levels of SPECIES_10090_mouse GENE_10090)_TSLP, GENE_10090)_high_mobility_group_box_1 (GENE_10090)_HMGB1), and GENE_10090)_receptor_for_advanced_glycation_end_products (GENE_10090)_RAGE) in airway epithelium and whole lung tissues were markedly increased in CHEMICAL_53557_TDI group compared with control SPECIES_10090_mice, which were decreased after administration of short GENE_10090)_TSLP.
28329851	Meanwhile, short GENE_10090)_TSLP also inhibited GENE_10090)_STAT5(Y694) phosphorylation, which was highly expressed in airways of CHEMICAL_53557_TDI-exposure SPECIES_10090_mice.
28329851	In vitro, both CHEMICAL_53557_TDI-human serum albumin (HSA) and recombinant SPECIES_9606_human (rh) GENE_3146_HMGB1 promoted long GENE_85480_TSLP but not short GENE_85480_TSLP gene production in SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE).
28329851	Cells pre-treated with short GENE_85480_TSLP exhibited less expression of GENE_177_RAGE and long GENE_85480_TSLP and lower phosphorylation of GENE_207_Akt(S473), p38 MAPK(T180/Y182), and GENE_6776_STAT5(Y694) than stimulated with CHEMICAL_53557_TDI-HSA or rhHMGB1 alone.
28329851	Results suggest that short GENE_85480_TSLP prevents DISEASE_D007249_airway_inflammation in a chemical-induced DISEASE_D001249_asthma model, which might be associated with the inhibitions of GENE_3146_HMGB1-GENE_177_RAGE and long GENE_85480_TSLP expression and GENE_6776_STAT5(Y694) phosphorylation.
28330766	Water metabolism dysfunction via renin-angiotensin system activation caused by DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage in SPECIES_10090_mice treated with CHEMICAL_C063855_microcystin_RR.
28330766	CHEMICAL_D052998_Microcystins (CHEMICAL__MCs) are a group of CHEMICAL__monocyclic_heptapeptide toxins that have been shown to act as potent hepatotoxins.
28330766	However, the observed symptoms of water metabolism disruption induced by CHEMICAL_C063855_microcystin_RR (CHEMICAL__MC_RR) or CHEMICAL__MCs have rarely been reported, and a relatively clear mechanism has not been identified.
28330766	In the present study, male SPECIES_10090_mice were divided into 4 groups (A: 140 g/kg, B: 70 g/kg,C: 35 g/kg, and D: 0 g/kg) and administered CHEMICAL__MC_RR daily for a month.
28330766	On day 8 of treatment, an increase in water intake and urine output was observed in the high-dose group compared with the control, and the symptoms worsened with the repeated administration of the toxin until day 30.
28330766	In addition, the urine specific gravity decreased and serum enzymes that can reflect hepatic damage increased in the high-dose group compared with the control (P<0.05).
28330766	The mRNA level of GENE_10090)_angiotensinogen (AGT) in hepatocytes was upregulated to approximately 150% of the control (P<0.05), and the serum renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was activated in the high-dose group; however, signs of DISEASE_D007674_renal_injury were not observed throughout the experiment.
28330766	After the toxin treatment was completed, the high levels of the RAS and vasopressin in group A returned to normal levels within 1 week.
28330766	As expected, the symptoms of DISEASE_D011141_polyuria and DISEASE_D059606_polydipsia also disappeared.
28330766	Therefore, we propose that water metabolism dysfunction occurs via RAS activation caused by DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage because the increased serum RAS levels in the experiment were consistent with the increased urine output and water intake in the SPECIES_10090_mice during the observation period.
28330766	In addition, we found for the first time that a RAS blocker could alleviate the observed DISEASE_D011141_polyuria and DISEASE_D059606_polydipsia and inactivate the high level of the RAS induced by CHEMICAL__MC_RR in a dose-dependent manner, which further supported our hypothesis.
28330870	GENE_4780_Nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2 enhances carcinogenesis by suppressing apoptosis and promoting autophagy in CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-transformed cells.
28330870	CHEMICAL_D009532_Nickel-containing compounds are widely used in industry.
28330870	CHEMICAL_D009532_Nickel is a known SPECIES_9606_human carcinogen that primarily affects the lungs.
28330870	Proposed mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-induced carcinogenesis include disruption of cellular CHEMICAL_D007501_iron homeostasis, generation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS), and induction of hypoxia signaling.
28330870	However, the precise molecular mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-induced malignant transformation and tumor development remain unclear.
28330870	This study shows that the transcription factor GENE_4780_Nrf2 is highly expressed in lung tumor tissue and in CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-transformed SPECIES_9606_human lung bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells (NiT cells).
28330870	Additionally, constitutively high levels of GENE_4780_Nrf2 play a critical role in apoptosis resistance in NiT cells.
28330870	Basal ROS levels were extremely low in NiT cells and were correlated with elevated expression levels of both antioxidant enzymes (e.g.
28330870	catalase and CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutases) and antiapoptotic proteins (e.g.
28330870	GENE_596_Bcl_2 and GENE_598_Bcl_xL).
28330870	These processes are tightly controlled by GENE_4780_Nrf2.
28330870	Autophagy inhibition, induced pharmacologically or genetically, enhanced CHEMICAL_49786_Ni2_-induced apoptosis, indicating that the induction of autophagy is the cause of apoptosis resistance in NiT cells.
28330870	Using similar approaches, we show that in NiT cells the inhibition of apoptosis decreases autophagy.
28330870	We have shown that GENE_6774_Stat3, which is up-regulated by GENE_4780_Nrf2, controls autophagy induction in NiT cells.
28330870	Colony formation and tumor growth were significantly attenuated by knockdown of GENE_4780_Nrf2 or GENE_596_Bcl_2.
28330870	Taken together, this study demonstrates that in NiT cells constitutively high GENE_4780_Nrf2 expression inhibits apoptosis by up-regulating antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins to increase autophagy via GENE_6774_Stat3 signaling.
28330870	These findings indicate that the GENE_4780_Nrf2-mediated suppression of apoptosis and promotion of autophagy contribute to CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-induced transformation and tumorigenesis.
28341135	CHEMICAL_D008694_Methamphetamine induces hepatotoxicity via inhibiting cell division, arresting cell cycle and activating apoptosis: In  vivo and in  vitro studies.
28341135	CHEMICAL_D008694_Methamphetamine (CHEMICAL_D008694_METH) resulted in acute DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_injury.
28341135	However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified.
28341135	In the present study, rats were treated with CHEMICAL_D008694_METH (15 mg/kg B.W.)
28341135	for 8 injections (i.p.
28341135	), and the levels of CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine transaminase, asparatate transaminase and ammonia in serum were significantly elevated over those in the control group, suggesting DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_injury, which was evidenced by histopathological observation.
28341135	Analysis of the liver tissues with microarray revealed differential expressions of a total of 332 genes in CHEMICAL_D008694_METH-treated rats.
28341135	According to the GO and KEGG annotations, a large number of down-regulated cell cycle genes were screened out, suggesting that CHEMICAL_D008694_METH induced cell cycle arrest and deficient of cell cycle checkpoint.
28341135	Related genes and proteins were confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blotting in rat livers, respectively.
28341135	Moreover, treatment of Brl-3A cells with CHEMICAL_D008694_METH caused significant cytotoxic response and marked cell cycle arrest.
28341135	Furthermore, overexpressions of Cidea, cleaved caspase 3 and PARP 1 in CHEMICAL_D008694_METH-treated rats indicated activation of apoptosis, while its inhibition alleviated cell death in Brl-3A cells, suggesting that activation of apoptosis took an important role in CHEMICAL_D008694_METH-induced hepatotoxicity.
28341135	Taken together, the present study demonstrates that CHEMICAL_D008694_METH induced hepatotoxicity via inducing cell cycle arrest and activating apoptosis.

28341137	Redox mediated DISEASE_D009369_cancer therapeutics are of immense interest in the recent decade due to their anticancer activity.
28341137	CHEMICAL_C008922_Piperine is the principal alkaloid of black and long pepper.
28341137	Although its anticancer activity has been reported in number of DISEASE_D009369_cancers , the precise molecular mechanism of action remains to be unravelled.
28341137	Hence, in this study, for the first time, we delineated the mechanistic insight into the effect of CHEMICAL_C008922_piperine against DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC).CHEMICAL_53233_MTT analysis determined the dose and time dependent DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of CHEMICAL_C008922_piperine against Hep G2 cells.
28341137	Further molecular studies evidenced the prooxidant property of CHEMICAL_C008922_piperine by inducing CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 driven mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in Hep G2 cells by inhibiting the CHEMICAL_44785_peroxide detoxifying enzyme GENE_847_Catalase.
28341137	Molecular docking and western blotting analysis uncovered the CHEMICAL_C008922_piperine mediated receptor CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine kinase inhibition and mitigation of DISEASE_D006528_HCC progression.
28341137	In addition, histological investigations of CHEMICAL_C008922_piperine - treated, CHEMICAL_34873_DEN-induced DISEASE_D006528_HCC SPECIES_10116_rats showed significant prognosis with apoptotic cell death.
28341137	Whereas,co-treatment of an antioxidant CHEMICAL_C433928_EUK_134 significantly abrogated its chemotherapeutic activity substantiating its radical-mediated anticancer property.
28341137	Altogether, this study shows that the CHEMICAL_C008922_piperine may be a promising prooxidant drug for the DISEASE_D006528_amelioration_of_hepatocellular_carcinoma.
28341147	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium stimulates myofibroblast differentiation and SPECIES_10090_mouse lung fibrosis.
28341147	Increasing evidence suggests that CHEMICAL__Cd at levels found in the SPECIES_9606_human diet can cause oxidative stress and activate redox-sensitive transcription factors in inflammatory signaling.
28341147	Following DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, tissue repair often involves activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors in fibroblasts.
28341147	In lungs, epithelial barrier remodeling is required to restore gas exchange and barrier function, and aberrant myofibroblast differentiation leads to DISEASE_D011658_pulmonary_fibrosis.
28341147	Contributions of exogenous exposures, such as dietary CHEMICAL__Cd, to DISEASE_D011658_pulmonary_fibrosis remain DISEASE_C536298_incompletely_defined.
28341147	In the current study, we tested whether CHEMICAL__Cd activates fibrotic signaling in SPECIES_9606_human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFLF) at micromolar and submicromolar CHEMICAL__Cd concentrations that do not cause cell death.
28341147	Exposure of HFLF to low-dose CHEMICAL__Cd (<= 1.0 M) caused an increase in stress fibers and increased protein levels of myofibroblast differentiation markers, including a-smooth muscle actin (a-GENE_6606_SMA) and extra-domain-A-containing fibronectin (ED-A-FN).
28341147	Assay of transcription factor (TF) activity using a 45-TF array showed that CHEMICAL__Cd increased activity of 12 TF, including GENE_4087;4088;4089_SMAD2_3_4 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog) signaling differentiation and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28341147	Results were confirmed by real-time PCR and supported by increased expression of target genes of GENE_4087;4088_SMAD2_3/4.
28341147	Immunocytochemistry of lungs of SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to low-dose CHEMICAL__Cd (0.3 and 1.0mg/L in drinking water) showed increased GENE_10090)_a_SMA protein level with lung CHEMICAL__Cd accumulation similar to lung CHEMICAL__Cd in non-smoking SPECIES_9606_humans.
28341147	Together, the results show that relatively low CHEMICAL__Cd exposures stimulate pulmonary fibrotic signaling and myofibroblast differentiation by activating GENE_4087;4088_SMAD2_3/4-dependent signaling.
28341147	The results indicate that dietary CHEMICAL__Cd intake could be an important variable contributing to DISEASE_D011658_pulmonary_fibrosis in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28341207	Transcriptome analysis of airborne PM2.5-induced detrimental effects on SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes.
28341207	Ambient air pollution is becoming more severe worldwide, posing a serious threat to SPECIES_9606_human health.
28341207	Fine airborne particles of particulate matter (PM2.5) show higher DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity than other coarse fractions.
28341207	Indeed, PM2.5 induces DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_or_respiratory_damage; however, few studies have evaluated the detrimental effect of PM2.5 to normal SPECIES_9606_human skin.
28341207	We used a next-generation sequencing-based (RNA-Seq) method with transcriptome and DISEASE_D030342_Gene_Ontology (DISEASE_D030342_GO) enrichment analysis to determine the harmful influences of PM2.5 on SPECIES_9606_human normal epidermal keratinocytes.
28341207	DAVID analysis showed that the most significantly enriched DISEASE_D030342_GO terms were associated with epidermis-related biological processes such as "epidermis development (DISEASE_D030342_GO: 0008544)" and "keratinocyte differentiation (DISEASE_D030342_GO: 0030216)", suggesting that PM2.5 has some deleterious effects to the SPECIES_9606_human epidermis.
28341207	In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted DISEASE_D007249_inflammation-related signaling as one of the major PM2.5-induced signaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokines as upstream regulators with symptoms similar to DISEASE_D011565_psoriasis as downstream effects.
28341207	PM2.5 caused considerable changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and psoriatic skin disease-related genes, might lead to DISEASE_D008107_epidermal_dysfunctions.
28341207	Our results might help to understand the mechanism of air pollution-induced skin barrier perturbation and contribute to the development of a new strategy for the prevention or recovery of the consequent damage.
28341571	Alterations in prostate morphogenesis in SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10116_rat offspring after maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_D003993_Di_n_butyl_phthalate (GENE_10116)_DBP).
28341571	Prostate morphogenesis is regulated by CHEMICAL_D000728_androgens hormones and modulated by morphogenetic proteins such as Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs).
28341571	This study aims to investigate the effects on prostate development in SPECIES_9606_male offspring and differentiation after gestational and lactational maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_D003993_Di_n_butyl_phthalate (GENE_1628_DBP), an important environmental contamination.
28341571	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats received 100 or 500mg/kg of GENE_10116)_DBP (CHEMICAL__DBP100 and GENE_10116)_DBP500), by gavage, from gestation day 15 (GD15) until postnatal day 21 (PND21).
28341571	The SPECIES_10090_pups were euthanized on PND1 and PND21.
28341571	Anogenital distance and CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels decreased in animals from exposed mothers (CHEMICAL__DBP100 and 500) on PND1.
28341571	A three-dimensional reconstruction model of the prostatic urethra showed reduction in the prostatic buds in the GENE_1628_DBP500 group.
28341571	AR expression and a-actin immunoreactivity decreased, and GENE_652_BMP_4 expression was lower on PND1 for GENE_1628_DBP500.
28341571	These results showed that GENE_1628_DBP exposure, especially at a higher dose, delayed prostate morphogenesis by reducing the CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone/AR axis and GENE_652_BMP_4 expression.
28341572	Cell and region specificity of CHEMICAL__Aryl_hydrocarbon Receptor (GENE_196_AhR) system in the testis and the epididymis.
28341572	GENE_196_Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor (GENE_196_AhR) plays multiple important functions in adaptive responses.
28341572	Exposure to GENE_196_AhR ligands may produce an altered metabolic activity controlled by the GENE_196_AhR pathways, and consequently affect drug/toxin responses, hormonal status and cellular homeostasis.
28341572	This research revealed species-, cell- and region-specific pattern of the GENE_10116)_AhR system expression in the SPECIES_10116_rat and SPECIES_9606_human testis and epididymis, complementing the existing knowledge, especially within the epididymal segments.
28341572	The study showed that GENE_10116)_AhR level in the SPECIES_10116_rat and SPECIES_9606_human epididymis is higher than in the testis.
28341572	The downregulation of GENE_196_AhR expression after CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD treatment was revealed in the spermatogenic cells at different stages and the epididymal epithelial cells, but not in the Sertoli and Leydig cells.
28341572	Hence, this basic research provides information about the GENE_196_AhR function in the testis and epididymis, which may provide an insight into deleterious effects of drugs, hormones and environmental pollutants on SPECIES_9606_male fertility.
28341573	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin alters uterine fluid volume and aquaporin (AQP) subunits (GENE_10116)_AQP_1, 2, 5 _ 7) expression in the uterus in the presence of CHEMICAL__sex_steroids in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28341573	Effects of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin on uterine fluid volume and aquaporin (AQP) expression in the uterus were investigated.
28341573	CHEMICAL_D004958_Estradiol (E) or CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol followed by CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone (E+P) were given to ovariectomised SPECIES_10116_rats with or without CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin (10, 50 or 100mg/kg/day) treatment.
28341573	Uteri were harvested and its inner/outer circumference ratio was determined.
28341573	GENE_358_AQP_1, 2, 5 and 7 mRNA and protein levels in uterus were quantified by Real-time PCR and Western blotting respectively.
28341573	Protein distribution was observed by immunohistochemistry.
28341573	Administration of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin in E-treated SPECIES_10116_rats decreased the uterine fluid volume and uterine GENE_10116)_AQP_2 expression.
28341573	In E+P-treated SPECIES_10116_rats, administration of 100mg/kg/day CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin increased uterine fluid volume, GENE_25240;25386_AQP_1_and_2 expression but decreased GENE_10116)_AQP_7 expression in uterus.
28341573	GENE_358_AQP_1 was distributed in stromal blood vessels while GENE_359_AQP_2, 5 and 7 were distributed in uterine epithelium.
28341573	CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin-induced changes in uterine fluid volume and AQP subunits expression in uterus could affect the uterine reproductive functions under different sex-CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid influence.
28342888	Effect of exogenous GENE_7040_TGF_b1 on the CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis of proximal tubular cells through PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.
28342888	Heavy metal polluted soils have been a serious problem for the global ecological balance and SPECIES_9606_people's health.
28342888	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium (CHEMICAL__Cd), one of the heavy metals, could induce apoptosis of proximal tubular cells in many experimental models and lead to damage the SPECIES_9606_human kidney.
28342888	Here, we reported a potent chemokine GENE_7040_TGF_b1 which could ameliorate CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity.
28342888	Interestingly, western blotting and TUNEL staining assays indicated that PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway was involved in the protective mechanism of GENE_7040_TGF_b1 in  vitro and in  vivo.
28342888	Moreover, GENE_7040_TGF_b1 could alleviate CHEMICAL__Cd-induced nephrotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis of proximal tubular cells through detecting the level of GENE_836;841;842_caspase_3_8_and_9.
28342888	Therefore, up-regulation of exogenous GENE_7040_TGF_b1 may be a potential strategy to reverse CHEMICAL__cadumium-induced nephrotoxicity.
28343033	CHEMICAL_C502851_Quinocetone induces mitochondrial apoptosis in HepG2 cells through ROS-dependent promotion of GENE_7416_VDAC1 oligomerization and suppression of GENE_7471_Wnt1/GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling pathway.
28343033	CHEMICAL_C502851_Quinocetone (CHEMICAL__QCT) has been used as an animal feed additive in China since 2003.
28343033	However, investigations indicate that CHEMICAL__QCT has potential DISEASE_D064420_toxicity due to the fact that it shows DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and immunotoxicity in  vitro and animal models.
28343033	Although CHEMICAL__QCT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis has been established, the molecular mechanism remains unclear.
28343033	This study was aimed to investigate the role of GENE_7416_voltage_dependent_anion_channel_1 (GENE_7416_VDAC1) oligomerization and Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin pathway in CHEMICAL__QCT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis.
28343033	The results showed VDAC inhibitor CHEMICAL_D017878_4_4_diisothiocyano_stilbene_2_2_disulfonic_acid (DIDS) partly compromised CHEMICAL__QCT-induced cell viability decrease (from 34.1% to 68.5%) and mitochondrial apoptosis accompanied by abating GENE_7416_VDAC1 oligomerization, GENE_54205_cytochrome_c (GENE_54205_Cyt_c) release and the expression levels of cleaved GENE_142;842;836_caspase_9_3_and_poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase (GENE_142_PARP).
28343033	Meanwhile, overexpression GENE_7416_VDAC1 exacerbated CHEMICAL__QCT-induced GENE_7416_VDAC1 oligomerization and GENE_54205_Cyt_c release.
28343033	In addition, CHEMICAL_D018021_lithium_chloride (CHEMICAL_D018021_LiCl), an activator of Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin pathway, markedly attenuated CHEMICAL__QCT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis by partly restoring the expression levels of GENE_7471_Wnt1 and GENE_1499_b_catenin.
28343033	Finally, reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) scavenger CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) obviously blocked CHEMICAL__QCT-induced GENE_7416_VDAC1 oligomerization and the inhibition of GENE_7471_Wnt1/GENE_1499_b_catenin pathway.
28343033	Taken together, our results reveal that CHEMICAL__QCT induces mitochondrial apoptosis by ROS-dependent promotion of GENE_7416_VDAC1 oligomerization and suppression of GENE_7471_Wnt1/GENE_1499_b_catenin pathway.
28346727	CHEMICAL_C473643_Sulforaphene enhances radiosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma through suppression of the NF-kB pathway.
28346727	CHEMICAL_C473643_Sulforaphene (CHEMICAL__SFE), a naturally occurring CHEMICAL_C037152_isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has attracted increasing attention for its anti-cancer effect in many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
28346727	However, the precise role of CHEMICAL__SFE in the radiosensitivity of HCC is still unclear.
28346727	Here, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CHEMICAL_53233_MTT and flow cytometry assay, respectively.
28346727	The activity of NF-kB was further evaluated by ELISA.
28346727	We also observed the effect of CHEMICAL__SFE and/or radiation on tumor growth.
28346727	The results showed that CHEMICAL__SFE inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells.
28346727	Radiation increased NF-kB activity, while CHEMICAL_C020972_PDTC, a NF-kB inhibitor, enhanced radiation-induced cell death.
28346727	CHEMICAL__SFE inhibited NF-kB activity and the downstream gene expressions of the NF-kB pathway in HCC cells.
28346727	Moreover, CHEMICAL__SFE enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiation on tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.
28346727	This study indicated that CHEMICAL__SFE sensitized the radiosensitivity of HCC by blocking the NF-kB pathway.
28347707	The involvement of GENE_10116)_sirtuin_1 and GENE_10116)_heme_oxygenase_1 in the hepatoprotective effects of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin against CHEMICAL_D002251_carbon_tetrachloride-induced DISEASE_D056486_sub_chronic_liver_toxicity in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28347707	The present study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin in a sub-chronic model of hepatotoxicity.
28347707	The roles of putative antioxidant enzymes, GENE_10116)_sirtuin_1 (GENE_10116)_SIRT1) and GENE_10116)_heme_oxygenase_1 (GENE_10116)_HO_1), in hepatoprotection were also addressed.
28347707	DISEASE_D056487_Sub_chronic_liver_injury was induced in SPECIES_10116_rats by intraperitoneal administration of 0.5  ml/kg CHEMICAL_D002251_carbon_tetrachloride (CHEMICAL__CTC), once every 3 days, for 2 weeks.
28347707	Some CHEMICAL__CTC SPECIES_10116_rats were concurrently treated with 100  mg/kg CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin, intragastrically, once every day, for 2 weeks.
28347707	The effects of these drugs in the liver were evaluated by biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological studies.
28347707	CHEMICAL__CTC triggered oxidative damage to the liver as unanimously shown by altered biochemical parameters and liver morphology.
28347707	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__CTC highly upregulated GENE_10116)_HO_1 and GENE_10116)_SIRT1 expression levels.
28347707	Concomitant treatment of SPECIES_10116_rats with CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin downregulated GENE_10116)_SIRT1 expression and ameliorated the hepatotoxic effects of CHEMICAL__CTC.
28347707	However, CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin did not have any significant effect on GENE_10116)_HO_1 expression and CHEMICAL_D001663_bilirubin levels.
28347707	Collectively, these results suggest that the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin in CHEMICAL__CTC treated SPECIES_10116_rats were GENE_10116)_SIRT1 mediated and less dependent on GENE_10116)_HO_1.
28347707	Thus, pharmacologic modulation of GENE_10116)_SIRT1 could provide a logic therapeutic approach in sub-chronic hepatotoxicity.
28348719	GENE_9529_BAG5 Interacts with GENE_11315_DJ_1 and Inhibits the Neuroprotective Effects of GENE_11315_DJ_1 to Combat Mitochondrial Oxidative Damage.
28348719	Loss-of-function mutations in gene encoding GENE_11315_DJ_1 contribute to the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive early-onset familial forms of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD).
28348719	GENE_11315_DJ_1 is a multifunctional protein and plays a protective role against oxidative stress-induced DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage and cell death, but the exact mechanism underlying this is not yet clearly understood.
28348719	Here, using coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescence methods, we prove that GENE_9529_Bcl_2_associated_athanogene_5 (GENE_9529_BAG5), a BAG family member, interacts with GENE_11315_DJ_1 in SPECIES_9606_mammalian cells.
28348719	Moreover, we show that GENE_9529_BAG5 could decrease stability of GENE_11315_DJ_1 and weaken its role in mitochondrial protection probably by influencing dimerization in stress condition.
28348719	Our study reveals the relationship of GENE_9529_BAG5 and GENE_11315_DJ_1 suggesting a potential role for GENE_9529_BAG5 in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D010300_PD through its functional interactions with GENE_11315_DJ_1.
28351761	GENE_11009_Interleukin_24 as a target cytokine of environmental CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor agonist exposure in the lung.
28351761	Exposure to environmental GENE_196_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor (GENE_196_AhR) agonists, such as CHEMICAL__halogenated_aromatic_hydrocarbons and CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons (CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs), has great impacts on the development of various DISEASE_D008171_lung_diseases.
28351761	As emerging molecular targets for GENE_196_AhR agonists, cytokines may contribute to the inflammatory or immunotoxic effects of environmental GENE_196_AhR agonists.
28351761	However, general cytokine expression may not specifically indicate environmental GENE_196_AhR agonist exposure.
28351761	By comparing cytokine and chemokine expression profiles in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_C538231_lung_adenocarcinoma cell line CL5 treated with GENE_196_AhR agonists and the non-GENE_196_AhR agonist CHEMICAL__polychlorinated_biphenyl (CHEMICAL_47136_PCB) 39, we identified a target cytokine of environmental GENE_196_AhR agonist exposure of in the lungs.
28351761	Thirteen cytokine and chemokine genes were altered in the GENE_196_AhR agonists-treated cells, but none were altered in the CHEMICAL__PCB39-treated cells.
28351761	GENE_11009_Interleukin_IL_24 was the most highly induced gene among GENE_196_AhR-modulated cytokines.
28351761	Cotreatment with GENE_196_AhR antagonist completely prevented GENE_11009_IL_24 induction by GENE_196_AhR agonists in the CL5 cells.
28351761	Knockdown GENE_196_AhR expression with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly reduced CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (CHEMICAL_29022_BaP)-induced GENE_11009_IL_24 mRNA levels.
28351761	We further confirmed that gene transcription, but not mRNA stability, was involved in GENE_11009_IL_24 upregulation by CHEMICAL_29022_BaP.
28351761	Particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air contains some CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs and is reported to activate GENE_196_AhR.
28351761	Oropharyngeal aspiration of PM significantly increased GENE_10090)_IL_24 levels in lung epithelia and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of SPECIES_10090_mice 4weeks after treatment.
28351761	Thus, our data suggests that GENE_11009_IL_24 is a pulmonary exposure target cytokine of environmental GENE_196_AhR agonists.
28352085	CHEMICAL_C543008_Bisphenol_S negatively affects the meotic maturation of SPECIES_9823_pig oocytes.
28352085	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), a chemical component of plastics, is a widely distributed environmental pollutant and contaminant of water, air, and food that negatively impacts SPECIES_9606_human health.
28352085	Concerns regarding CHEMICAL__BPA have led to the use of CHEMICAL__BPA-free alternatives, one of which is CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS).
28352085	However, the effects of CHEMICAL__BPS are not well characterized, and its specific effects on reproduction and fertility remain unknown.
28352085	It is therefore necessary to evaluate any effects of CHEMICAL__BPS on SPECIES_9606_mammalian oocytes.
28352085	The present study is the first to demonstrate the markedly negative effects of CHEMICAL__BPS on SPECIES_9823_pig oocyte maturation in vitro, even at doses lower than those SPECIES_9606_humans are exposed to in the environment.
28352085	Our results demonstrate (1) an effect of CHEMICAL__BPS on the course of the meiotic cell cycle; (2) the failure of tubulin fibre formation, which controls proper chromosome movement; (3) changes in the supply of maternal mRNA; (4) changes in the protein amounts and distribution of CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen receptors a and b and of aromatase; and (5) disrupted cumulus cell expansion.
28352085	Thus, these results confirm that CHEMICAL__BPS is an example of regrettable substitution because this substance exerts similar or even worse negative effects than those of the material it replaced.
28349193	Time-matched analysis of DNA adduct formation and early gene expression as predictive tool for renal carcinogenesis in CHEMICAL_D008746_methylazoxymethanol_acetate treated Eker rats.
28349193	Genotoxic carcinogens pose great hazard to human health.
28349193	Uncertainty of current risk assessment strategies and long latency periods between first carcinogen exposure and diagnosis of tumors have raised interest in predictive biomarkers.
28349193	Initial DNA adduct formation is a necessary step for genotoxin induced carcinogenesis.
28349193	However, as DNA adducts not always translate into tumorigenesis, their predictive value is limited.
28349193	Here we hypothesize that the combined analysis of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts along with time-matched gene expression changes could serve as a superior prediction tool for genotoxic carcinogenesis.
28349193	Eker rats, heterozygous for the tuberous sclerosis (Tsc2) tumor suppressor gene and thus highly susceptible towards genotoxic renal carcinogens, were continuously treated with the DNA alkylating carcinogen CHEMICAL_D008746_methylazoxymethanol_acetate (CHEMICAL__MAMAc).
28349193	Two weeks of CHEMICAL__MAMAc treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase of CHEMICAL_C008449_O6_methylguanine and CHEMICAL_C008450_N7_methylguanine adducts in the kidney cortex, which was however not reflected by significant expression changes of cyto-protective genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
28349193	Instead, we found a transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the tumor-related MAPK, FoxO and TGF-beta pathways.
28349193	Continuous CHEMICAL__MAMAc treatment for up to 6  months resulted in a mild but significant increase of cancerous lesions.
28349193	In summary, the combined analysis of DNA adducts and early gene expression changes could serve as a suitable predictive tool for genotoxicant-induced carcinogenesis.
28356238	Hepatic effects of CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine (E 102) after systemic exposure are independent of CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen receptor interactions in the SPECIES_10090_mouse.
28356238	CHEMICAL_D013645_Tartrazine is a food colour that activates the transcriptional function of the SPECIES_9606_human CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen receptor alpha in an in vitro cell model.
28356238	Since CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogens are cholestatic, we hypothesised CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine will cause periportal DISEASE_D056486_injury_to_the_liver in vivo.
28356238	To test this hypothesis, CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine was initially administered systemically to SPECIES_10090_mice resulting in a periportal recruitment of inflammatory cells, increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity and mild periportal DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28356238	To determine whether an oestrogenic effect may be a key event in this response, CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine, sulphonated metabolites and a food additive contaminant were screened for their ability to interact with SPECIES_10090_murine CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen receptors.
28356238	In all cases, there were no interactions as agonists or antagonists and further, no oestrogenicity was observed with CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine in an in vivo uterine growth assay.
28356238	To examine the relevance of the hepatic effects of CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine to its use as a food additive, CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine was orally administered to transgenic NF-kB-Luc SPECIES_10090_mice.
28356238	Pre- and concurrent oral treatment with CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol was incorporated given its potential to promote gut permeability and DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_inflammation.
28356238	CHEMICAL_D013645_Tartrazine alone induced NF- kB activities in the colon and liver but there was no periportal recruitment of inflammatory cells or DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28356238	CHEMICAL_D013645_Tartrazine, its sulphonated metabolites and the contaminant inhibited sulphotransferase activities in SPECIES_10090_murine hepatic S9 extracts.
28356238	Given the role of sulfotransferases in CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid excretion, the initiating event giving rise to periportal DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and subsequent hepatic pathology through systemic CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine exposure is therefore potentially associated an inhibition of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid sulphation and excretion and not on CHEMICAL_50114_oestrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional function.
28356238	However, these effects were restricted to systemic exposures to CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine and did not occur to any significant effect after oral exposure.
28359723	Apoptotic effect of CHEMICAL_C100698_demethoxyfumitremorgin_C from marine fungus SPECIES_746128_Aspergillus_fumigatus on GENE_57332_PC3 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer cells.
28359723	CHEMICAL_C100698_Demethoxyfumitremorgin_C, a secondary metabolite of the marine fungus, SPECIES_746128_Aspergillus_fumigatus, had been reported to demonstrate cytotoxic effect on SPECIES_10090_mouse tsFT210  cells.
28359723	However, no information is available regarding its functional mechanism and the chemo-sensitization effects on different kinds of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells.
28359723	We found that treatment of CHEMICAL_C100698_demethoxyfumitremorgin_C inhibited the cell viability of GENE_57332_PC3 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D011471_advanced_prostate_cancer cells, induced apoptosis as determined by GENE_308_Annexin_V/CHEMICAL_D011419_propidium_iodide double staining, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.
28359723	CHEMICAL_C100698_Demethoxyfumitremorgin_C induced apoptosis was associated with downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins: Ras, PI3K, GENE_207_Akt, GENE_598_Bcl_xL, and GENE_596_Bcl_2, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic GENE_581_Bax.
28359723	CHEMICAL_C100698_Demethoxyfumitremorgin_C activated GENE_836;841;842_caspase_3_8_and_9, leading to GENE_1302_PARP cleavage.
28359723	Additionally, caspase inhibitors blocked CHEMICAL_C100698_demethoxyfumitremorgin_C-induced apoptosis of GENE_57332_PC3 cells.
28359723	These results suggest that CHEMICAL_C100698_demethoxyfumitremorgin_C from SPECIES_746128_Aspergillus_fumigatus inhibits the proliferation of GENE_57332_PC3 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer cells via the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic pathway, followed by downstream events leading to apoptotic cell death.
28359723	CHEMICAL_C100698_Demethoxyfumitremorgin_C could therefore, serve as a useful agent to treat SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D011471_advanced_prostate_cancer.
28363435	CHEMICAL_C055494_Caffeic_acid_phenethyl_ester protects against glucocorticoid-induced DISEASE_D010024_osteoporosis in vivo: Impact on oxidative stress and GENE_8600_RANKL/OPG signals.
28363435	DISEASE_D010024_Glucocorticoid_induced_osteoporosis (DISEASE_D010024_GIO) is one of the most common causes of secondary DISEASE_D010024_osteoporosis.
28363435	Given that glucocorticoids are considered as a main component of the treatment protocols for a variety of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and immune-mediated diseases besides its use as adjuvant to several chemotherapeutic agents, it is crucial to find ways to overcome this critical adverse effect.
28363435	CHEMICAL_C055494_Caffeic_acid_phenethyl_ester (CHEMICAL__CAPE), which is a natural compound derived from SPECIES_7460_honeybee propolis displayed promising antiosteoporotic effects against mechanical DISEASE_D001847_bone_injury in various studies.
28363435	The current work aimed at investigating the potential protective effect of CHEMICAL__CAPE against DISEASE_D010024_GIO in vivo with emphasis on the modulation of oxidative status and GENE_8600_receptor_activator_of_NF_kB_ligand (GENE_8600_RANKL)/osteoprotegrin (OPG) signaling.
28363435	The results showed that CHEMICAL__CAPE opposed CHEMICAL_D003907_dexamethasone (CHEMICAL_D003907_DEX)-mediated alterations in bone histology and CHEMICAL__tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity.
28363435	In addition, CHEMICAL__CAPE restored oxidative balance, GENE_860_Runt_related_transcription_factor_2 (GENE_860_RunX2) expression and reduced GENE_836_caspase_3 activity in femur tissues.
28363435	Co-administration of CHEMICAL__CAPE with CHEMICAL_D003907_DEX normalized GENE_8600_RANKL/OPG ratio and Akt activation indicating a reduction in CHEMICAL_D003907_DEX-osteoclastogenesis.
28363435	In conclusion, concurrent treatment of CHEMICAL__CAPE with CHEMICAL_D003907_DEX exhibited promising effects in the protection against CHEMICAL_D003907_DEX-induced DISEASE_D010024_osteoporosis through opposing osteoclastogenesis and protecting osteoblasts.
28363435	The potent antioxidant activity of CHEMICAL__CAPE is, at least in part, involved in its anti-apoptotic effects and modulation of GENE_860_RunX2 and GENE_8600_RANKL/OPG signals.
28363435	The use of CHEMICAL__CAPE-enriched propolis formulas is strongly recommended for SPECIES_9606_patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy to help in the attenuation of DISEASE_D010024_GIO.
28365685	CHEMICAL_C045651__Epigallocatechin_3_Gallate Inhibits CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic-Induced DISEASE_D007249_Inflammation and Apoptosis through Suppression of Oxidative Stress in SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28365685	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic in individuals has been found to be associated with various health-related problems including DISEASE_D012871_skin_lesions, DISEASE_D009369_cancer, and DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_and_immunological_disorders.
28365685	CHEMICAL_C045651__Epigallocatechin_3_gallate (CHEMICAL_4806_EGCG), the main and active CHEMICAL__polyphenolic_catechin present in green tea, has shown potent antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activity in vivo and in vitro.
28365685	Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of CHEMICAL_4806_EGCG against CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and immunotoxicity in mice.
28365685	METHODS: Serum GENE_10090)_IL_1b, GENE_10090)_IL_6 and GENE_10090)_TNF_a were determined by ELISA, tissue GENE_10090)_catalase (GENE_10090)_CAT), CHEMICAL_D008315_malonyldialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA), CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD), CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH), CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide and GENE_10090)_caspase_3 by commercial kits, mitochondrial membrane potential with Rh 123, mitochondrial ROS with CHEMICAL_C029569_2_7_dichlorofluorescin_diacetate (CHEMICAL_C029569_DCFH_DA), apoptotic and DISEASE_D009336_necrotic cells and T-cell phenotyping with Flow cytometry analysis.
28365685	RESULTS: The results showed that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic treatment significantly increased oxidative stress levels (as indicated by GENE_10090)_catalase, CHEMICAL_D008315_malonyldialdehyde, CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase, CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione and reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species), increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and promoted apoptosis.
28365685	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic exposure increased the relative frequency of the CD8+(Tc) cell subpopulation (from 2.8 to 18.9%) and decreased the frequency of CD4+(Th) cells (from 5.2 to 2.7%).
28365685	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic exposure also significantly decreased the frequency of T(CD3) (from SPECIES_10090_32_5% to 19.2%) and B(GENE_10090)_CD19) cells (from 55.1 to 32.5%).
28365685	All of these effects induced by CHEMICAL_29678_NaAsO2 were attenuated by CHEMICAL_4806_EGCG.
28365685	CONCLUSIONS: The present in vitro findings indicate that CHEMICAL_4806_EGCG attenuates not only CHEMICAL_29678_NaAsO2-induced immunosuppression but also DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis.
28365874	Developmental CHEMICAL_D014807_Vitamin_D (DVD) DISEASE_D011488_Deficiency_Reduces_Nurr1 and TH Expression in Post-mitotic CHEMICAL_D004298_Dopamine Neurons in SPECIES_10116_Rat Mesencephalon.
28365874	DISEASE_D006130_Developmental_vitamin_D_DVD_deficiency has been proposed as an important risk factor for DISEASE_D012559_schizophrenia.
28365874	Our previous study using SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats found that DISEASE_D006130_DVD_deficiency disrupted the ontogeny of mesencephalic CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neurons by decreasing the mRNA level of a crucial differentiation factor of CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine cells, the nuclear receptor related 1 protein (GENE_10116)_Nurr1).
28365874	However, it remains unknown whether this reflects a reduction in CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine cell number or in GENE_4929_Nurr1 expression.
28365874	It is also unclear if any particular subset of developing CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neurons in the mesencephalon is selectively affected.
28365874	In this study, we employed state-of-the-art spinning disk confocal microscopy optimized for the imaging of tissue sections and 3D segmentation to assess post-mitotic CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine cells on a single-cell basis in the SPECIES_10116_rat mesencephalon at embryonic day 15.
28365874	Our results showed that DISEASE_D006130_DVD_deficiency did not alter the number, morphology, or positioning of post-mitotic CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine cells.
28365874	However, the ratio of GENE_4929_Nurr1+TH+ cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) compared with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) was increased in DISEASE_D006130_DVD_deficient SPECIES_6239_embryos.
28365874	In addition, the expression of GENE_4929_Nurr1 in immature CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine cells and mature CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neurons in the VTA was decreased in DISEASE_D006130_DVD_deficient group.
28365874	GENE_7054_Tyrosine_hydroxylase was selectively reduced in SNc of DISEASE_D006130_DVD_deficient mesencephalon.
28365874	We conclude that DISEASE_D006130_DVD_deficiency induced early alterations in mesencephalic CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine development may in part explain the abnormal CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine-related behaviors found in this model.
28365874	Our findings may have broader implications for how certain environmental risk factors for DISEASE_D012559_schizophrenia may shape the ontogeny of dopaminergic systems and by inference increase the risk of DISEASE_D012559_schizophrenia.
28366046	CHEMICAL_C017947_Sodium_arsenite-induced DISEASE_D007674_cardiovascular_and_renal_dysfunction in SPECIES_10116_rat via oxidative stress and protein kinase B (GENE_10116)_Akt_PKB) signaling pathway.
28366046	OBJECTIVES: CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic is a ubiquitous element that is widely distributed in the environment to which SPECIES_9606_man and animals are exposed.
28366046	DISEASE_D002318_Cardiovascular_disease is one of the aftermaths of chronic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure-related morbidity and mortality.
28366046	This study sought to investigate the possibility of reversal from CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced DISEASE_D007674_cardio_renal_toxicity following exposure and subsequent withdrawal.
28366046	The study also seeks to understand the mechanism of action of this reversal.
28366046	METHODS: SPECIES_10116_Rats were orally exposed to CHEMICAL_C017947_sodium_arsenite at 10, 20 and 40   mg/kg daily for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of withdrawal.
28366046	RESULTS: Exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic caused a significant increase in CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde, CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 generation but decrease total CHEMICAL_29256_thiol and reduced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione levels in both cardiac and renal tissues.
28366046	Furthermore, increases in CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase, CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-CHEMICAL__S-transferase and GENE_10116)_catalase with significant increases in CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase activities were observed in the cardiac tissues.
28366046	On the contrary, a significant reduction in the renal antioxidant enzyme activity was recorded following exposure.
28366046	Also, antioxidant defense system did not return to apparent values after CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic withdrawal.
28366046	Immunohistochemistry revealed a reduction in the expression of the pro-survival protein-protein kinase B (GENE_10116)_Akt_PKB) following exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and this was not reversed by withdrawal Discussion: Exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic caused DISEASE_D007674_cardio_renal_toxicity via induction of oxidative stress and down-regulation of GENE_10116)_Akt_PKB expressions.
28363843	GENE_54106_Toll_like_receptor_9 mediates CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_acute_lung_injury: an in vitro and in vivo study.
28363843	AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the role of GENE_54106_Toll_like_receptor_9 in CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_acute_lung_injury (DISEASE_D055371_ALI).
28363843	MAIN METHODS: For in vivo study,C57BL SPECIES_10090_mice were randomly assigned into the vehicle control group, CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat group, CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat + GENE_10090)_TLR9 antagonist (CHEMICAL__ODN2088) group, and GENE_10090)_TLR9 antagonist (CHEMICAL__ODN2088) group (n=36 per group).
28363843	After CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat 30mg/kg ip for 2, 24 and 48h, serum samples and lung tissues were collected to evaluate DISEASE_D055371_ALI and GENE_54106_TLR9 signaling by DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury score, protein levels of GENE_54106_TLR9, GENE_4615_MyD88, p-GENE_51135_IRAK4, p-p65, and serum GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3553_IL_1b levels.
28363843	As for in vitro research A549 cells were randomly divided into the control group, CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat group, CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat + GENE_54106_TLR9 siRNA group, and GENE_54106_TLR9 siRNA group.
28363843	After CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat treatment for 24h, the cells and supernatant were collected to measureTLR9, GENE_7124_TNF_a, GENE_3553_IL_1 mRNA expression, and detect activation of NF-kB, GENE_836_caspase_3.
28363843	KEY FINDINGS: In vivo, the DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury score, the GENE_54106_TLR9, GENE_4615_MyD88, p-GENE_51135_IRAK4 and p-p65 protein levels, and cytokines GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3553_IL_1b levels in CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat group were significantly higher than that in the control group;GENE_54106_TLR9 blocker CHEMICAL__ODN2088 pretreatment attenuated DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury, inhibited GENE_4615_MyD88 and NF-kB activation, and reduced GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3553_IL_1b in serum.
28363843	In vitro result shows that the gene silencing of GENE_54106_TLR9 reduced the mRNA expression of GENE_54106_TLR9, GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3553_IL_1, inhibited NF-kB and GENE_836_caspase_3 activation, attenuated cell apoptosis.
28363843	SIGNIFICANCE: GENE_54106_TLR9 mediates CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI, antagonizing GENE_54106_TLR9 or silencing GENE_54106_TLR9gene may attenuate CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI.
28364798	Antioxidative cellular response of lepidopteran ovarian cells to CHEMICAL__photoactivated_alpha_terthienyl.
28364798	Photodynamic sensitizers as useful alternative agents have been used for population control against insect pests, and the response of insect ovarian cells towards the photosensitizers is gaining attention because of the next reproduction.
28364798	In this paper, antioxidative responses of lepidopteran ovarian SPECIES_9694_Tn5B1_4 and Sf-21 cells to CHEMICAL__photoactivated_alpha_terthienyl (CHEMICAL_74926_PAT) are investigated.
28364798	CHEMICAL_74926_PAT shows positive inhibitory DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity on the two ovarian cells, and its inhibition on cell viability is enhanced as the concentrations are increased and the irradiation time is extended.
28364798	Median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) are 3.36 g/ml to SPECIES_9694_Tn5B1_4 cells, and 3.15 g/ml to Sf-21 cells at 15min-UV-A irradiation 2h-dark incubation.
28364798	Under 10.0 g/ml CHEMICAL_74926_PAT exposure, 15min-UV-A irradiation excites higher ROS production than 5min-UV-A irradiation does in the ovarian cells, the maximum ROS content is about 7.1 times in SPECIES_9694_Tn5B1_4 cells and 4.3 times in Sf-21 cells, and the maximum CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde levels in SPECIES_9694_Tn5B1_4 and Sf-21 cells are about 1.47- and 1.36-fold higher than the control groups, respectively.
28364798	Oxidative stress generated by CHEMICAL_74926_PAT strongly decreases the activities of POD, SOD and CAT, and induces an accumulation of SPECIES_9694_Tn5B1_4 cells in S phase and Sf-21 cells in G2/M phase in a concentration-dependent fashion.
28364798	Apoptosis accumulation of SPECIES_9694_Tn5B1_4 cells and the persistent post-irradiation DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity are further observed, indicating different antioxidative tolerance and arrest pattern of the two ovarian cells towards the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of CHEMICAL_74926_PAT.
28366736	LncRNA GENE_79686_LINC00341 mediates PM2.5-induced cell cycle arrest in SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells.
28366736	Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) could adhere to many toxic substances and cause DISEASE_D012131_respiratory_diseases.However, the associated pathogenic mechanism remains unclear.
28366736	In this study, we investigated the effects of PM2.5 on cell cycle progression in SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) and the underlying mechanism mediated by lncRNAs.
28366736	PM2.5 treatment inhibited cell proliferation in 16HBE cells in a dose-dependent manner.
28366736	The results of flow cytometry assay (FCM) showed that PM2.5 induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.
28366736	The lncRNA microarray analysis indicated that treatment with PM2.5 led to the alteration of lncRNA expression profiles.
28366736	qRT-PCR were performed to confirm the differential expression of several candidate lncRNAs.
28366736	lncRNA GENE_79686_LINC00341 was significantly up-regulated in 16HBE cell after PM2.5 treatment.
28366736	Further functional studies showed that knockdown of lncRNA GENE_79686_LINC00341 reversed PM2.5-induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and GENE_644914_p21 expression.
28366736	These results suggest that up-regulation of the lncRNA GENE_79686_LINC00341 mediates PM2.5-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and probably through regulating the expression of GENE_644914_p21.
28369636	Maternal CHEMICAL_C017690_Fenvalerate Exposure Induces Fetal CHEMICAL__Intrauterine Growth Restriction Through Disrupting Placental Thyroid Hormone Receptor Signaling.
28369636	CHEMICAL_C017690_Fenvalerate is an environmental endocrine disruptor that disrupts CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone and CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol synthesis.
28369636	Nevertheless, whether CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate disturbs placental TR signaling remains unclear.
28369636	The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate exposure causes fetal DISEASE_D005317_intrauterine_growth_restriction (DISEASE_D005317_IUGR) and to explore the role of placental CHEMICAL_60311_thyroid_hormone receptor (TR) signaling.
28369636	Pregnant SPECIES_10090_mice except controls were orally administered to CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate (0.2, 2.0, or 20   mg/kg) daily throughout pregnancy.
28369636	As expected, fetal weight was lowered in dams that were administered with 20.0   mg/kg of CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate.
28369636	Moreover, the rate of DISEASE_D005317_IUGR was elevated not only in SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_fetuses but also in female SPECIES_10090_fetuses of dams exposed to 20.0   mg/kg of CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate.
28369636	Histopathology showed that the internal space of blood vessels in the labyrinth layer was smaller in placentas of SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate.
28369636	Mechanistic study found no significant difference on TT4 level in maternal serum, although TT3 level in maternal serum was slightly reduced in dams exposed to 2.0   mg/kg of CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate.
28369636	Interestingly, placental GENE_10090)_TRa1 and GENE_10090)_TRb1 mRNAs were reduced in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate.
28369636	Moreover, nuclear translocation of placental GENE_10090)_TRb1 was suppressed in CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28369636	Further analysis showed that placental GENE_10090)_Vegfa and GENE_10090)_Igf2, several target genes of TR signaling, were down-regulated in CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28369636	In addition, mRNA level of placental GENE_10090)_CD36, Snat1, and Snat2, 3 nutrient transporters, were reduced in CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28369636	These results suggest that maternal CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate exposure induces fetal DISEASE_D005317_IUGR through disrupting placental TR signaling.
28369636	These results provide a novel mechanistic explanation for CHEMICAL_C017690_fenvalerate-induced fetal DISEASE_D005317_IUGR.
28369034	GENE_6603_SMARCD2 subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes mediates granulopoiesis through a GENE_1050_CEBP   dependent mechanism.
28369034	Recent studies suggest that individual subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes produce biologically specific meaning in different cell types through combinatorial assembly.
28369034	Here we show that granulocyte development requires GENE_6603_SMARCD2, a subunit of CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-dependent SWI/SNF (GENE_8815_BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes.
28369034	GENE_10090)_Smarcd2-deficient SPECIES_10090_mice fail to generate functionally mature neutrophils and eosinophils, a phenotype reminiscent of DISEASE_C562873_neutrophil_specific_granule_deficiency (DISEASE_C562873_SGD) in SPECIES_9606_humans, for which loss-of-function mutations in GENE_1053_CEBPE (encoding GENE_1050_CEBP  ) have been reported.
28369034	GENE_6603_SMARCD2-containing SWI/SNF complexes are necessary for GENE_1050_CEBP   transcription factor recruitment to the promoter of neutrophilic secondary granule genes and for granulocyte differentiation.
28369034	The homologous GENE_6602_SMARCD1 protein (63% identical at the CHEMICAL_D000596_amino_acid level) cannot replace the role of GENE_6603_SMARCD2 in granulocyte development.
28369034	We find that GENE_6603_SMARCD2 functional specificity is conferred by its divergent coiled-coil 1 and SWIB domains.
28369034	Strikingly, both GENE_1053_CEBPE and GENE_6603_SMARCD2 loss-of-function mutations identified in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_C562873_SGD abolish the interaction with SWI/SNF and thereby secondary granule gene expression, thus providing a molecular basis for this disease.
28373009	CHEMICAL_D005557_Formaldehyde and co-exposure with CHEMICAL_D001554_benzene induce compensation of bone marrow and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in BALB/c SPECIES_10090_mice during post-exposure period.
28373009	CHEMICAL_D005557_Formaldehyde (FA) is a SPECIES_9606_human leukemogen.
28373009	Since there is a latency period between initial FA exposure and the development of DISEASE_D007938_leukemia, the subsequent impact of FA on hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs) in post-exposure stage is crucial for a deep understanding of FA-induced hematotoxicity.
28373009	BALB/c SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to 3mg/m(3) FA for 2weeks, mimicking occupational exposure, and were monitored for another 7days post-exposure.
28373009	Meanwhile, we included CHEMICAL_D001554_benzene (CHEMICAL__BZ) as a positive control, separately and together with FA because co-exposure occurs frequently.
28373009	After 7-day recovery, colonies of progenitors for CFU-GM and BFU-E, and nucleated bone marrow cells in FA-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice were comparable to controls, although they were significantly reduced during exposure.
28373009	Levels of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) and CHEMICAL_C067134_8_hydroxy_2_deoxyguanosine (CHEMICAL_C067134_8_OHdG) in CFU-GM and BFU-E from FA-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice were higher than controls, although the increase in CHEMICAL_C067134_8_OHdG was not significant.
28373009	GENE_10090)_Granulocyte_macrophage_colony_stimulating_factor (GENE_10090)_GM_CSF) level in the FA group was lower than controls, but the expression level for the receptor was not upregulated.
28373009	It suggests that HSCs/HPCs in FA-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice respond to a small amount of GENE_10090)_GM_CSF and proliferate rapidly, which may cause a possible risk of expansion of abnormal stem/progenitor cell clones.
28373009	FA co-exposure with CHEMICAL__BZ was more potent for promoting CFU-GM formation and inducing ROS in BFU-E and CHEMICAL_C067134_8_OHdG in CFU-GM during the post-exposure period.
28373009	The compensation of myeloid progenitors with elevated ROS and CHEMICAL_C067134_8_OHdG may lead to a risk of transforming normal HSCs/HPCs to leukemic stem/progenitor cells.
28373009	Thus, co-exposure may pose a greater DISEASE_D007938_leukemia risk.
28369585	From the Cover: MechanisticInsights in DISEASE_D064420_Cytotoxic and Cholestatic Potential of the Endothelial Receptor Antagonists Using HepaRG Cells.
28369585	Several endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been developed for the treatment of DISEASE_D006976_pulmonary_arterial_hypertension (DISEASE_D006976_PAH).
28369585	Some of them have been related to clinical cases of DISEASE_D056486_hepatocellular_injury (CHEMICAL__sitaxentan [CHEMICAL__SIT]) and/or DISEASE_D002779_cholestasis (bosentan [BOS]).
28369585	We aimed to determine if CHEMICAL_C467894_ambrisentan (CHEMICAL_D000666_AMB) and CHEMICAL_C533860_macitentan (CHEMICAL__MAC), in addition to BOS and CHEMICAL__SIT, could potentially cause DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage in SPECIES_9606_man by use of SPECIES_9606_human HepaRG cells.
28369585	Our results showed that like BOS, CHEMICAL__MAC-induced DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and DISEASE_D002779_cholestatic_disorders characterized by bile canaliculi dilatation and DISEASE_D003072_impairment_of_myosin light chain kinase signaling.
28369585	CHEMICAL_C533860_Macitentan also strongly inhibited CHEMICAL_D013656_taurocholic_acid and CHEMICAL__carboxy_2_7_dichlorofluorescein efflux while it had a much lower inhibitory effect on influx activity compared to BOS and CHEMICAL__SIT.
28369585	Moreover, these three drugs caused decreased intracellular accumulation and parallel increased levels of total CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids (CHEMICAL_32590_BAs) in serum-free culture media.
28369585	In addition, all drugs except CHEMICAL_D000666_AMB variably deregulated gene expression of BA transporters.
28369585	In contrast, CHEMICAL__SIT was hepatotoxic without causing DISEASE_D002779_cholestatic_damage, likely via the formation of reactive metabolites and CHEMICAL_D000666_AMB was not hepatotoxic.
28369585	Together, our results show that some ERAs can be hepatotoxic and that the recently marketed CHEMICAL__MAC, structurally similar to BOS, can also cause cholestatic alterations in HepaRG cells.
28369585	The absence of currently known or suspected cases of DISEASE_D002779_cholestasis in SPECIES_9606_patients suffering from DISEASE_D006976_PAH treated with CHEMICAL__MAC is rationalized by the lower therapeutic doses and Cmax, and longer receptor residence time compared to BOS.
28371137	CHEMICAL_C013221_Proanthocyanidin protects against CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced oxidative liver damage through inhibition of inflammation and NF-kb/TLR-4 pathway.
28371137	Although CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin (CHEMICAL__CIS) is a highly effective anticancer drug, hepatotoxicity is one of the most common adverse effects associated with its use.
28371137	Recently, reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation are suggested to be key factors in the pathophysiology of CHEMICAL__CIS-induced acute liver damage.
28371137	The aim of this study is to investigate the possible protective effect of CHEMICAL_C013221_proanthocyanidin (CHEMICAL_32866_PRO) against CHEMICAL__CIS-induced acute hepatotoxicity.
28371137	Rats were divided into four groups: 1, Control; 2, CHEMICAL_32866_PRO; 3, CHEMICAL__CIS; and 4, CHEMICAL_32866_PRO   +   CHEMICAL__CIS.
28371137	Biochemical studies and histopathology were used to assess liver damage.
28371137	ROS, inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kb), inducible cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2), inducible CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide synthase (iNOS), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) gene expression, and apoptotic markers were also assessed.
28371137	CHEMICAL_32866_PRO pretreatment protected the liver against CHEMICAL__CIS-induced toxicity as indicated by decreased plasma levels of liver function enzymes and the normal liver histopathology observed in the CHEMICAL_32866_PRO   +   CHEMICAL__CIS group.
28371137	CHEMICAL_32866_PRO pretreatment also diminished indicators of oxidative stress in the liver, including CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO) and CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA).
28371137	It also increased the antioxidants, CHEMICAL_D005978_reduced_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH), CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (GPx), CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the liver.
28371137	Plasma interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) were all reduced.
28371137	Liver gene expression of NF-kb, COX-2, iNOS, and TLR-4 were all downregulated.
28371137	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_32866_PRO administration downregulated the liver expression of the apoptotic marker, Bax, while upregulated the antiapoptotic marker, Bcl2.
28371137	In conclusion, our results revealed that CHEMICAL_32866_PRO may protect against CHEMICAL__CIS-induced acute liver damage mainly through inhibition of ROS, inflammation, and apoptosis.
28378122	Interplay between lysosomal, mitochondrial and death receptor pathways during CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese-induced apoptosis in glial cells.
28378122	CHEMICAL_D008345_Manganese (CHEMICAL__Mn) is an essential trace metal which plays a critical role in brain physiology by acting as a cofactor for several enzymes.
28378122	However, upon overexposure, CHEMICAL__Mn preferentially accumulates within the basal ganglia leading to the development of a DISEASE_D010302_Parkinsonism known as Manganism.
28378122	Data from our group have proved that CHEMICAL__Mn induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in DISEASE_D001254_astrocytoma C6 cells.
28378122	In the present study we described how cathepsins impact on different steps of each apoptotic cascade.
28378122	Evidence obtained demonstrated that CHEMICAL__Mn generates lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cathepsin release.
28378122	Both cathepsins B (GENE_730249_Ca_074_Me_and_D (CHEMICAL_C031375_Pepstatin_A) inhibitors as well as CHEMICAL_C040929_Bafilomycin_A1 prevented GENE_836;840;841;842_caspases_3_7_8_and_9 activation, GENE_356_FasL upregulation, Bid cleavage,     m disruption and GENE_54205_cytochrome_c release.
28378122	Results from in vivo studies showed that intrastriatal CHEMICAL__Mn injection increased GENE_1509_cathepsin_D levels from corpus striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta.
28378122	Our results point to LMP and lysosomal cathepsins as key mediators in the apoptotic process triggered by CHEMICAL__Mn.
28378122	These findings highlight the relevance of targeting the lysosomal pathway for Manganism therapy.
28373059	Protective properties of CHEMICAL_C007845_6_gingerol-rich fraction from Zingiber officinale (Ginger) on CHEMICAL_D004390_chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative damage and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in the brain, ovary and uterus of SPECIES_10116_rats.
28373059	CHEMICAL_D004390_Chlorpyrifos (CHEMICAL__CPF) is an CHEMICAL_D010755_organophosphorus pesticide widely used in agricultural applications and household environments.
28373059	CHEMICAL_C007845_6_Gingerol-rich fraction from Zingiber officinale (Ginger, CHEMICAL__6_GRF) has been reported to possess potent anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.
28373059	Here, we investigated the protective properties of CHEMICAL__6_GRF on CHEMICAL__CPF-induced oxidative damage and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in the brain, ovary and uterus of SPECIES_10116_rats.
28373059	Five groups of SPECIES_10116_rats containing 14 SPECIES_10116_rats/group received SPECIES_381124_corn oil (control), CHEMICAL__CPF (5  mg/kg), CHEMICAL__6_GRF (100  mg/kg), CHEMICAL__CPF (5  mg/kg)  +  CHEMICAL__6_GRF (50  mg/kg) and CHEMICAL__CPF (5  mg/kg)  +  CHEMICAL__6_GRF (100  mg/kg) through gavage once per day for 35 days respectively.
28373059	The results showed that CHEMICAL__6_GRF protected against CHEMICAL__CPF-induced increases in oxidative stress ((CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide (CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2) and CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA)), inflammatory (GENE_10116)_myeloperoxidase (GENE_10116)_MPO), CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO) and GENE_10116)_tumour_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_10116)_TNF_a)), and apoptotic (GENE_10116)_caspase_3) markers.
28373059	Also, CHEMICAL__6_GRF improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes GENE_10116)_catalase, CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD), CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and GENE_10116)_glutathione_S_transferase (GENE_10116)_GST) as well as CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH) level in the brain, ovary and uterus of SPECIES_10116_rats exposed to CHEMICAL__CPF (p  <  0.05).
28373059	Overall, the protective effects of CHEMICAL__6_GRF on CHEMICAL__CPF-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in the brain and reproductive organs of SPECIES_10116_rats may be due to its potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties.
28377118	Single low doses of CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP decrease CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the absence of overt neuron loss.
28377118	DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) is the second most common age-related DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disease.
28377118	CHEMICAL_D015632_1_Methyl_4_phenyl_1_2_3_6_tetrahydropyridine (CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP) is a prototypical neurotoxicant used in SPECIES_10090_mice to mimic primary features of DISEASE_D010300_PD pathology including striatal CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine depletion and CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc).
28377118	In the literature, CHEMICAL__there are several experimental paradigms involving multiple doses of CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP that are used to elicit CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neuron loss.
28377118	However, a recent study reported that a single low dose caused significant loss of CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neurons.
28377118	Here, we determined the effect of a single intraperitoneal injection of one of CHEMICAL__three doses of CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP (0.1, 2 and 20mg/kg) on CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neurons, labeled by CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine hydroxylase (TH(+)), and total neuron number (Nissl(+)) in the SNc using unbiased stereological counting.
28377118	Data reveal a significant loss of neurons in the SNc (TH(+) and CHEMICAL__Nissl_) only in the group treated with 20mg/kg CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP.
28377118	Groups treated with lower dose of GENE_10090)_MPTP_0_1_and_2mg/kg) only showed significant loss of TH(+) neurons rather CHEMICAL__than_TH(+) and Nissl(+) neurons.
28377118	Striatal CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine levels were decreased in the groups treated with 2 and 20mg/kg CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP and striatal terminal markers including, TH and the GENE_10090)_dopamine_transporter (GENE_10090)_DAT), were only decreased in the groups treated with 20mg/kg CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP.
28377118	CHEMICAL__These data demonstrate that lower doses of CHEMICAL_D015632_MPTP likely result in loss of TH expression rather than actual CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neuron loss in the SN.
28377118	This finding reinforces the need to measure both total neuron number along with TH(+) cells in determining CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine neuron loss.
28377212	Differentiating true CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor inhibition from DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity-mediated reduction of reporter-gene transactivation in-vitro.
28377212	In vitro effect-based reporter assays are applied as biodetection tools designed to address nuclear receptor mediated-modulation.
28377212	While such assays detect receptor modulating potential, cell viability needs to be addressed, preferably in the same well.
28377212	Some assays circumvent this by co-transfecting a second constitutively-expressed marker gene or by multiplexing a DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity assay.
28377212	Some assays, such as the CALUX  , lack this feature.
28377212	The cytotoxic effects of unknown substances can confound in vitro assays, making the interpretation of results difficult and uncertain, particularly when assessing antagonistic activity.
28377212	It's necessary to determine whether the cause of the reporter signal decrease is an antagonistic effect or a non-specific cytotoxic effect.
28377212	To remedy this, we assessed the suitability of multiplexing a cell viability assay within the CALUX   transcriptional activation test for anti-androgenicity.
28377212	Tests of both well-characterized anti-CHEMICAL_D000728_androgens and cytotoxic compounds demonstrated the suitability of this approach for discerning between the molecular mechanisms of action without altering the nuclear receptor assay; though some compounds were both cytotoxic and anti-androgenic.
28377212	The optimized multiplexed assay was then applied to an uncharacterized set of polycyclic aromatic compounds.
28377212	These results better characterized the mode of action and the classification of effects.
28377212	Overall, the multiplexed protocol added value to CALUX test performance.
28385952	CHEMICAL_D004026_Dieldrin Augments GENE_7955)_mTOR Signaling and Regulates Genes Associated with DISEASE_D002318_Cardiovascular_Disease in the Adult SPECIES_7955_Zebrafish Heart (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio).
28385952	CHEMICAL_D004026_Dieldrin is a legacy CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticide that is persistent in the environment, despite being discontinued from use in North America since the 1970s.
28385952	Some epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin is associated with increased risks of DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disease and DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer by inducing inflammatory responses in tissues as well as oxidative stress.
28385952	However, the direct effects of CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticides on the heart have not been adequately addressed to date given that these chemicals are detectable in human serum and are environmentally persistent; thus, individuals may show latent adverse effects in the cardiovascular system due to long-term, low-dose exposure over time.
28385952	Our objective was to determine whether low-level exposure to CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin at an environmentally relevant dose results in aberrant molecular signaling in the vertebrate heart.
28385952	Using transcriptomic profiling and immunoblotting, we determined the global gene and targeted protein expression response to CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin treatment and show that CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin affects gene networks in the heart that are associated with processes related to DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease, specifically DISEASE_D006323_cardiac_arrest and DISEASE_D014693_ventricular_fibrillation.
28385952	We report that genes regulating inflammatory responses, a significant risk factor for DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease, are upregulated by CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin whereas transcripts related to lysosomal function are significantly downregulated.
28385952	To verify these findings, proteins in these pathways were examined with immunoblotting, and our results demonstrate that CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin constitutively activates Akt/GENE_7955)_mTOR signaling and downregulates lysosomal genes, participating in autophagy.
28385952	Our data demonstrate that CHEMICAL_D004026_dieldrin induces genes associated with DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_dysfunction and compromised lysosomal physiology, thereby identifying a novel mechanism for pesticide-induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity.
28389404	Protective role of CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin on CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone induced SPECIES_10116_rat model of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease: DISEASE_D011596_Suppression_of_neuroinflammation and oxidative stress mediated apoptosis.
28389404	DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) is a DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra which is associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis.
28389404	CHEMICAL_D047310_Apigenin (CHEMICAL_9141_AGN), a non-mutagenic    avone found in fruits and vegetables, exhibits a variety of biological effects including anti-apoptotic, anti-in   ammatory, and free radical scavenging activities.
28389404	The current study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of CHEMICAL_9141_AGN in a SPECIES_10116_rat model of DISEASE_D010300_PD induced by CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone (CHEMICAL__ROT).
28389404	Unilateral stereotaxic intranigral infusion of CHEMICAL__ROT caused the loss of GENE_10116)_tyrosine_hydroxylase (GENE_10116)_TH) immunoreactivity in striatum and substantia nigra.
28389404	CHEMICAL_9141_AGN treatment (10 and 20  mg/kg, i.p.)
28389404	showed a significant improvement in behavioral, biochemical and mitochondrial enzyme activities as compared to CHEMICAL__ROT exposed SPECIES_10116_rats.
28389404	The mRNA expression of inflammatory markers and neurotrophic factors was quantified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
28389404	Administration of CHEMICAL_9141_AGN significantly attenuated the upregulation of GENE_10116)_NF_kB gene expression in CHEMICAL__ROT induced group and prevented the neuroinflammation in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).
28389404	Further, CHEMICAL_9141_AGN inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines GENE_10116)_TNF_a, GENE_10116)_IL_6 and pro-inflammatory enzyme iNOS-1 induced by CHEMICAL__ROT.
28389404	Additionally, CHEMICAL_9141_AGN prevents the reduction of neurotrophic factors GENE_10116)_BDNF and GENE_10116)_GDNF mRNA expression in CHEMICAL__ROT lesioned SPECIES_10116_rats.
28389404	Immunoblot results illustrated that CHEMICAL_9141_AGN treatment downregulated a-synuclein aggregation and upregulated the GENE_10116)_TH protein expression as well as CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) expression in CHEMICAL__ROT lesioned SPECIES_10116_rats.
28389404	Thus, the present findings collectively suggest that CHEMICAL_9141_AGN exerts its neuroprotection in CHEMICAL__ROT model of DISEASE_D010300_PD and may act as an effective agent for treatment of DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28391263	CHEMICAL_C066201_Salvianolic_Acid_A Protects H9c2 Cells from CHEMICAL_C006632_Arsenic_Trioxide-Induced Injury via Inhibition of the MAPK Signaling Pathway.
28391263	BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate whether CHEMICAL_C066201_Salvianolic_acid_A (CHEMICAL__Sal_A) conferred cardiac protection against CHEMICAL_C006632_Arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO)-induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity in H9c2 cells by inhibiting MAPK pathways activation.
28391263	METHODS: H9c2 cardiac cells were exposed to 10   M CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO for 24 h to induce DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28391263	The cells were pretreated with CHEMICAL__Sal_A for 4 h before exposure to CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO.
28391263	Cell viability was determined utilizing the CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay.
28391263	The percentage of apoptosis was measured by a CHEMICAL_D016650_FITC-GENE_308_Annexin_V/PI apoptosis kit for flow cytometry.
28391263	Mitochondrial membrane potential (     m) was detected by JC-1.
28391263	The intracellular ROS levels were measured using an Image-iTTM LIVE Green Reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_Oxygen Species Detection Kit.
28391263	The apoptosis-related proteins and the MAPK signaling pathways proteins expression were quantified by Western blotting.
28391263	RESULTS: CHEMICAL__Sal_A pretreatment increased cell viability, suppressed CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and significantly altered the apoptotic rate by enhancing endogenous antioxidative enzyme activity and ROS generation.
28391263	Signal transduction studies indicated that CHEMICAL__Sal_A suppressed the CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO-induced activation of the MAPK pathway.
28391263	More importantly, JNK, ERK, and GENE_1432_p38 inhibitors mimicked the cytoprotective activity of CHEMICAL__Sal_A against CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO-induced injury in H9c2 cells by increasing cell viability, up-regulating GENE_596_Bcl_2 protein expression, and down-regulating both GENE_581_Bax and GENE_836_caspase_3 protein expression.
28391263	CONCLUSION: CHEMICAL__Sal_A decreases the CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO-induced apoptosis and DISEASE_D009336_necrosis of H9c2 cells, and the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect of CHEMICAL__Sal_A may be connected with the MAPK pathways.
28392392	Combining transcriptomics and PBPK modeling indicates a primary role of DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia and altered circadian signaling in CHEMICAL_D008752_dichloromethane carcinogenicity in SPECIES_10090_mouse lung and liver.
28392392	CHEMICAL_D008752_Dichloromethane (CHEMICAL_15767_DCM) is a lung and liver carcinogen in SPECIES_10090_mice at inhalation exposures>= 2000ppm.
28392392	The modes of action (MOA) of these responses have been attributed to formation of genotoxic, reactive metabolite(s).
28392392	Here, we examined gene expression in lung and liver from female B6C3F1 SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to 0, 100, 500, 2000, 3000 and 4000ppm CHEMICAL_15767_DCM for 90days.
28392392	We also simulated dose measures - rates of CHEMICAL_15767_DCM oxidation to CHEMICAL_D002248_carbon_monoxide (CO) in lung and liver and expected blood carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) time courses with a PBPK model inclusive of both conjugation and oxidation pathways.
28392392	Expression of large numbers of genes was altered at 100ppm with maximal changes in the numbers occurring by 500 or 2000ppm.
28392392	Most changes in genes common to the two tissues were related to cellular metabolism and circadian clock.
28392392	At the lower concentrations, the changes in metabolism-related genes were discordant - up in liver and down in lung.
28392392	These processes included organelle biogenesis, CHEMICAL_30956_TCA cycle, and respiratory electron transport.
28392392	Changes in circadian cycle genes - primarily transcription factors - showed strong concentration-related response at higher concentrations (GENE_10090)_Arntl, GENE_10090)_Npas2, and Clock were down-regulated; GENE_10090)_Cry2, GENE_10090)_Wee1, GENE_10090)_Bhlhe40, GENE_10090)_Per3, GENE_10090)_Nr1d1, GENE_10090)_Nr1d2 and GENE_10090)_Dbp) were up-regulated with similar directionality in both tissues.
28392392	Overall, persistently elevated HbCO from CHEMICAL_15767_DCM oxidation appears to cause extended periods of DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia, leading to altered circadian coupling to cellular metabolism.
28392392	The dose response for altered circadian processes correlates with the DISEASE_D009369_cancer outcome.
28392392	We found no evidence of changes in genes indicative of responses to cytotoxic, DNA-reactive metabolites.
28389379	Exposure to welding fumes activates DNA damage response and redox-sensitive transcription factor signalling in SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28389379	BACKGROUND: Occupational exposure to welding fumes containing a complex mixture of genotoxic heavy metals, radiation, gases and nanoparticles poses a serious health hazard to welders.
28389379	Since their categorization as possible carcinogens, welding fumes have gained increasing attention as high priority agents for risk assessment.
28389379	OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of welding fume inhalation on oxidative stress, DNA damage response (DDR), and GENE_10116)_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2 (GENE_10116)_Nrf2) and GENE_10116)_nuclear_factor_kappa_B (GENE_10116)_NFkB) signalling in the lung tissues of male SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28389379	METHODS: Animals were divided into five groups.
28389379	Group 1 animals served as control.
28389379	SPECIES_10116_Rats in groups 2-5 were exposed to 50mg/m(3) stainless steel (SS) welding fumes for 1h for 1day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks respectively.
28389379	Reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation, CHEMICAL_C067134_8_oxo_2_deoxyguanosine (CHEMICAL_C067134_8_oxodG), xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) and antioxidants were analysed.
28389379	DNA damage sensors, DNA repair enzymes, inflammatory mediators, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and key players in GENE_10116)_Nrf2 and GENE_10116)_NFkB signalling were assessed by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
28389379	RESULTS: SPECIES_10116_Rats exposed to welding fumes showed increased levels of CHEMICAL_D002857_chromium and ROS in lung tissues associated with accumulation of CHEMICAL_C067134_8_oxodG and enhanced expression of XMEs and antioxidants.
28389379	This was accompanied by upregulation of DNA damage sensors, cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase, overexpression of a multitude of DNA repair enzymes and caspase-mediated apoptosis.
28389379	In addition, exposure to welding fumes induced activation of GENE_10116)_Nrf2 and GENE_10116)_NFkB signalling with enhanced expression of inflammatory mediators.
28389379	CONCLUSION: The results of the present study unequivocally demonstrate that exposure of SPECIES_10116_rats to SS welding fumes alters the expression of 37 genes involved in oxidative stress, DISEASE_C565043_detoxification, inflammation, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis.
28389379	Activation of DDR and the ROS-sensitive GENE_10116)_Nrf2 and GENE_10116)_NFkB signalling pathways may be key molecular events that mediate adaptive cellular response to welding fume exposure.
28395332	CHEMICAL_C464485_Acetamiprid inhibits CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone synthesis by affecting the mitochondrial function and cytoplasmic CHEMICAL_D000255_adenosine_triphosphate production in SPECIES_10116_rat Leydig cells.
28395332	The insecticide CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid is used to control noxious agricultural pests.
28395332	However, it can cause SPECIES_9606_mammalian DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28395332	We evaluated the reproductive DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid in adult male SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28395332	SPECIES_10116_Rats were given oral CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid alone or with CHEMICAL_D014810_vitamin_E for 35 days.
28395332	SPECIES_10116_Rat plasma CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone concentration and sperm quality decreased significantly as the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) increased after exposure.
28395332	At the same time, CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid increased CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde and CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO) levels of Leydig cells.
28395332	Further analysis showed that CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid reduced the CHEMICAL_D000255_adenosine_triphosphate (CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP) and CHEMICAL__cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate (CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP) production of Leydig cells, but the expression of GENE_10116)_luteinizing_hormone_choriogonadotropin_receptor (GENE_10116)_LHCGR) and the activity of CHEMICAL__adenylyl cyclase were not changed.
28395332	CHEMICAL_C464485_Acetamiprid exposure also significantly diminished protein levels of GENE_10116)_steroidogenic_acute_regulatory_protein (GENE_10116)_STAR), CHEMICAL__hydroxy_delta_5_steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid delta-isomerase cluster (GENE_10116)_HSD3B), and GENE_29680;25251_cytochrome_P450_family_11_subfamily_a_polypeptide_1 (GENE_10116)_CYP11A1), and testicular mRNA levels, which are CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP-dependent proteins that are essential for steroidogenesis.
28395332	Electron microscopy indicated mitochondrial membrane damage in the Leydig cells of the testes of exposed SPECIES_10116_rats.
28395332	CHEMICAL_D014810_Vitamin_E ameliorated the impairment of CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid on Leydig cells.
28395332	Our results indicate that CHEMICAL_C464485_acetamiprid causes oxidative stress and DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage in Leydig cells and inhibits the synthesis of testicular CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP and CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP.
28395332	CHEMICAL_C464485_Acetamiprid disrupts subsequent CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone biosynthesis by decreasing the rate of conversion of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol to CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone and by preventing CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol from entering the mitochondria within the Leydig cells.
28395332	These effects caused reproductive damage to the SPECIES_10116_rats.
28396216	Assessment of the potential activity of major dietary compounds as selective CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor modulators in two distinct cell models for proliferation and differentiation.
28396216	CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen receptors (ERs) a and b are distributed in most tissues of SPECIES_9606_women and SPECIES_9606_men.
28396216	ERs are bound by CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol (E2), a natural hormone, and mediate the pleiotropic and tissue-specific effects of E2, such as proliferation of breast epithelial cells or protection and differentiation of neuronal cells.
28396216	Numerous environmental molecules, called endocrine disrupting compounds, also interact with ERs.
28396216	Phytoestrogens belong to this large family and are considered potent therapeutic molecules that act through their selective CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) activity.
28396216	Using DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell lines as a model of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-dependent proliferation and a stably ER-expressing PC12 cell line as a model of neuronal differentiating cells, we studied the SERM activity of major dietary compounds, such as CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin, CHEMICAL_C083152_liquiritigenin, CHEMICAL_C004742_daidzein, CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein, CHEMICAL_D003375_coumestrol, CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol and CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone.
28396216	The ability of these compounds to induce ER-transactivation and DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell proliferation and enhance Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) -induced neuritogenesis was assessed.
28396216	Surprisingly, although all compounds were able to activate the ER through an CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen responsive element reporter gene, they showed differential activity toward proliferation or differentiation.
28396216	CHEMICAL_D047310_Apigenin and CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol showed a partial or no proliferative effect on DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells but fully contributed to the neuritogenesis effect of NGF.
28396216	However, CHEMICAL_C004742_daidzein and CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone showed full effects on cellular proliferation but did not induce cellular differentiation.
28396216	In summary, our results suggest that the therapeutic potential of phytoestrogens can diverge depending on the molecule and the phenotype considered.
28396216	Hence, CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin and CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol might be used in the development of therapeutics for DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer and DISEASE_D001927_brain_diseases.
28396702	Interaction between prenatal pesticide exposure and a common polymorphism in the GENE_5444_PON1 gene on DNA methylation in genes associated with cardio-metabolic disease risk-an exploratory  study.
28396702	BACKGROUND: Prenatal environmental conditions may influence disease risk in later life.
28396702	We previously found a gene-environment interaction between the GENE_5444_paraoxonase_1 (GENE_5444_PON1) PROTEINMUTATION_662_Q192R genotype and prenatal pesticide exposure leading to an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile at school age.
28396702	However, the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been resolved.
28396702	It was hypothesized that epigenetics might be involved.
28396702	The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether DNA methylation patterns in blood cells were related to prenatal pesticide exposure level, GENE_5444_PON1 PROTEINMUTATION_662_Q192R genotype, and associated metabolic effects observed in the SPECIES_9606_children.
28396702	RESULTS: A specific methylation profile was observed in prenatally pesticide exposed SPECIES_9606_children carrying the GENE_5444_PON1 192R-allele.
28396702	Differentially methylated genes were enriched in several neuroendocrine signaling pathways including CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine-GENE_84152_DARPP32 feedback (appetite, reward pathways), corticotrophin releasing hormone signaling, GENE_4842_nNOS, neuregulin signaling, GENE_2475_mTOR signaling, and DISEASE_D003920_type_II_diabetes_mellitus signaling.
28396702	Furthermore, we were able to identify possible candidate genes which mediated the associations between pesticide exposure and increased leptin level, body fat percentage, and difference in BMI Z score between birth and school age.
28396702	CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism explaining an adverse cardio-metabolic health profile in SPECIES_9606_children carrying the GENE_5444_PON1 192R-allele and prenatally exposed to pesticides.
28392238	CHEMICAL__Organochloride pesticides modulated gut microbiota and influenced CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid metabolism in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28392238	CHEMICAL__Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) can persistently accumulate in body and threaten SPECIES_9606_human health.
28392238	CHEMICAL_D001647_Bile_acids and intestinal microbial metabolism have emerged as important signaling molecules in the host.
28392238	However, knowledge on which intestinal microbiota and CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids are modified by OCPs remains unclear.
28392238	In this study, adult male C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to p, CHEMICAL__p_dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (CHEMICAL_D003633_p_p_DDE) and CHEMICAL__b_hexachlorocyclohexane (CHEMICAL__b_HCH) for 8 weeks.
28392238	The relative abundance and composition of various bacterial species were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
28392238	CHEMICAL_3098_Bile_acid composition was analyzed by metabolomic analysis using UPLC-MS.
28392238	The expression of genes involved in hepatic and enteric CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids metabolism was measured by real-time PCR.
28392238	Expression of genes in CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids synthesis and transportation were measured in HepG2 cells incubated with CHEMICAL_D003633_p_p_DDE and CHEMICAL__b_HCH.
28392238	Our findings showed OCPs changed relative abundance and composition of intestinal microbiota, especially in enhanced Lactobacillus with CHEMICAL_3098_bile_salt hydrolase (BSH) activity.
28392238	OCPs affected CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid composition, enhanced hydrophobicity, decreased expression of genes on CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid reabsorption in the terminal ileum and compensatory increased expression of genes on synthesis of CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids in the liver.
28392238	We demonstrated that chronic exposure of OCPs could impair intestinal microbiota; as a result, hepatic and enteric CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid profiles and metabolism were influenced.
28392238	The findings in this study draw our attention to the hazards of chronic OCPs exposure in modulating CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid metabolism that might cause DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disorders and their potential to cause related diseases in SPECIES_9606_human.
28393075	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A Exposure during Pregnancy Alters the Mortality and Levels of Reproductive Hormones and Genes in Offspring SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28393075	The present study investigated the reproductive DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) exposure to the mother on the offspring SPECIES_10090_mice.
28393075	CHEMICAL__BPA was given to pregnant SPECIES_10090_mice at 50   mg/kg, 500   mg/kg, and 2500   mg/kg BW CHEMICAL__BPA daily by gavage during the whole gestation period.
28393075	The offspring SPECIES_10090_mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks of age.
28393075	Results showed that exposure of CHEMICAL__BPA to the mother increased the mortality (P < 0.05).
28393075	Maternal exposure of CHEMICAL__BPA reduced the levels of T (   ) and FSH (   ) (P < 0.01) and elevated E2 (   ) level in the adult offspring (P < 0.01).
28393075	CHEMICAL__BPA exposure caused DISEASE_D009422_testicular_damage as shown by less Leydig cells and DISEASE_D010049_ovarian_injury as shown by more vacuoles and less corpus granules in the adult offspring SPECIES_10090_mice.
28393075	Immunohistochemistry revealed that maternal exposure of CHEMICAL__BPA increased GENE_10090)_Bax and decreased GENE_10090)_Bcl_2 at the protein levels in testicular and ovary tissues in the offspring SPECIES_10090_mice.
28393075	CHEMICAL__BPA significantly reduced the expression of GENE_10090)_StAR in male offspring (P < 0.05).
28393075	Interestingly, the mRNA levels of GENE_10090)_Cyp11a were significantly decreased in 50   mg/kg groups and were increased in 500   mg/kg group in the males.
28393075	Reduced Kitlg and elevated Amh at the mRNA levels were detected in the female offspring.
28400324	Impact of anatase CHEMICAL_C009495_titanium_dioxide nanoparticles on mutagenic and genotoxic response in SPECIES_10029_Chinese_hamster lung fibroblast cells (V-79): The role of cellular uptake.
28400324	The unique physico-chemical properties of nano crystalline anatase CHEMICAL_C009495_titanium_dioxide nanoparticles (CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs) render them with different biological and chemical activities.
28400324	Hence, it is widely used in industrial and consumer applications.
28400324	Previous studies have shown the genotoxicity of CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs.
28400324	However, there is a paucity of data regarding mutagenicity of these NPs.
28400324	In the present study, the cellular uptake, sub-cellular localization, DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and short term DNA interaction of CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs (1-100   gmL(-1)) of diameter ranging from 12 to 25  nm on SPECIES_9606_mammalian lung fibroblast cells (V-79) has been studied.
28400324	The flow cytometric analysis and electron micrographs of CHEMICAL__V_79 monolayer showed the internalization of CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs in the cytoplasm with the confirmation of elemental composition through SEM/EDX analysis.
28400324	TEM analysis also showed CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs induced ultra-structural changes such as swollen mitochondria and nuclear membrane disruption in V-79  cells.
28400324	CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs generated free radicals, which induced indirect mutagenic and genotoxic responses.
28400324	Apart from measuring the genotoxicity by Comet assay, the mutagenic potential of CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs in V-79  cells was evaluated by SPECIES_9606_mammalian GENE_3251_HGPRT gene forward mutation assay, showing a 2.98- fold increase in 6TG(R) GENE_3251_HGPRT mutant frequency (*p  <  0.05, **p  <  0.01, ***p  <  0.001) by culture plate method, which is an early indicator of potential carcinogenicity.
28400324	Hence, CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs should be closely monitored and there should be a judicious use and disposal of NPs.
28397090	CHEMICAL_C011559_Tributyltin in male SPECIES_10090_mice disrupts CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis as well as recovery after exposure: mechanism analysis.
28397090	CHEMICAL__Organotin compounds such as CHEMICAL_C011559_tributyltin (CHEMICAL_27086_TBT) and CHEMICAL_C030665_triphenyltin can induce DISEASE_D003920_diabetes and insulin resistance.
28397090	However, the development of DISEASE_D003920_diabetes caused by CHEMICAL__organotins and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
28397090	In the present study, male KM SPECIES_10090_mice were orally administered with CHEMICAL_27086_TBT (0.5, 5, and 50   g/kg) once every 3  days for 45  days.
28397090	Their body weights increased and reached a significant difference compared to the control, and the fasting blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose levels were significantly elevated.
28397090	The fasting levels of serum insulin and GENE_9370_adiponectin increased, while glucagon levels decreased in the animals treated with CHEMICAL_27086_TBT.
28397090	The expression of the GENE_3643_insulin_receptor (GENE_3643_IR) signaling cascade, including GENE_3643_IR, GENE_3643_IR substrate, CHEMICAL_D010716_phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GENE_207_Akt, and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporter 4, was inhibited both in the skeletal muscle and the liver, which might be a main reason for the DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia and DISEASE_D006946_hyperinsulinemia.
28397090	After removing the CHEMICAL_27086_TBT stress for 60  days, the animals which had received exposure to CHEMICAL_27086_TBT could recover normoglycemia, accompanied with a recovery of the suppressed GENE_3643_IR signal pathway and fasting insulin levels.
28397090	However, the fasting levels of serum GENE_10090)_adiponectin and glucagon were lower than that of the control SPECIES_10090_mice, which would remain a potential risk inducing the disruption of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis.
28400101	Overcoming the exacerbating effects of CHEMICAL_D011899_ranitidine on NSAID-induced small intestinal DISEASE_D064420_toxicity with CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin: Providing a complete GI solution.
28400101	There is a need to find/discover novel leads to treat complex and/or multi-factorial-pathogenic disease(s) like Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)-induced DISEASE_C535952_gastroenteropathy or gastrointestinal (GI) DISEASE_D064420_toxicity as it has emerged as an important medical and socioeconomic problem.
28400101	There is no approved therapeutic strategy to prevent NSAID-induced DISEASE_D009422_enteropathic_damage and highly effective gastro-protective drugs such as CHEMICAL_D011899_ranitidine_hydrochloride (CHEMICAL__RAN) exacerbate it.
28400101	In this purview, the multi target drug discovery approach (MTDD), combination approach and hit to lead strategies based on the foundation of ethnopharmacology and/or reverse pharmacology holds strong potential.
28400101	Hence, the primary objectives of the current study were to explore the mechanism behind the preventative/curative effects of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin (CHEMICAL__QCT) on CHEMICAL__RAN exacerbated CHEMICAL_D004008_diclofenac_sodium (CHEMICAL_D003606_DIC)-induced DISEASE_D009422_enteropathic_damage and to assess the effects of co-administration of CHEMICAL__QCT and CHEMICAL__RAN on CHEMICAL_D003606_DIC-induced DISEASE_D009422_gastropathic_damage in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28400101	SPECIES_10116_Rats were treated twice daily with CHEMICAL__QCT (35, 50 and 100  mg  kg(-1) PO) and/or CHEMICAL__RAN (15  mg  kg(-1) PO) or vehicle for a total of 10 days.
28400101	In some experiments, CHEMICAL_D003606_DIC (9  mg  kg(-1)) was administered orally twice daily for the final 5 days of CHEMICAL__RAN/CHEMICAL__QCT  +  CHEMICAL__RAN/vehicle administration.
28400101	SPECIES_10116_Rats in all the groups were fasted after the last dose on 9th day (free access to water).
28400101	12 h after the last dose on 10th day, SPECIES_10116_rats were euthanized and their GI tracts were assessed for DISEASE_D006474_haemorrhagic_damage, alteration in CHEMICAL_D019820_xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, lipid peroxidation, intestinal permeability and GI luminal pH alterations along with haematological and biochemical estimations.
28400101	The macroscopic, haematological, biochemical and histological evidences suggested that, though, CHEMICAL__RAN prevented the CHEMICAL_D003606_DIC-induced DISEASE_D013272_gastric_injury, it exacerbated DISEASE_D009422_enteropathic_damage.
28400101	However, CHEMICAL__QCT not only significantly attenuated the CHEMICAL__RAN-induced exacerbation of DISEASE_D009422_enteropathic_damage caused by CHEMICAL_D003606_DIC at the doses of 50 and 100  mg  kg(-1), but, this combination provided complete GI safety against the toxic effects of CHEMICAL_D003606_DIC too.
28400101	The mechanisms behind the gastro-enteroprotective ability of CHEMICAL__QCT may be related to its ability to inhibit XO activity thus, preventing enhanced oxidative stress on GI tissues, prevent lipid peroxidation, IP alteration and alteration in GI luminal pH.
28400101	The preventative effects of CHEMICAL__QCT on NSAID-induced DISEASE_C535952_gastroenteropathy were ably supported by the CHEMICAL__QCT induced prevention of GI DISEASE_D006473_blood_loss and serum protein loss.
28400101	These pharmaco-mechanistic results of CHEMICAL__QCT are aligning to combination based MTDD approach and hence we propose it as a promising lead to treat NSAID-gastroenteropahty and related complications.
28400208	Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) pre-exposure contributes to the anti-oxidant response impairment in hCMEC/D3 during post-CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose DISEASE_D009422_deprivation_damage.
28400208	Recently, air pollution has been identified as a significant modifiable risk factor to the increasing DISEASE_D020521_stroke burden.
28400208	Diesel exhaust particles, characterized by high CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons content, constitute an important component of outdoor air pollution and is known to cause oxidative stress, and could therefore contribute to and exacerbate the effects of ROS in post-DISEASE_D007511_ischemic_injury.
28400208	hCMEC/D3 cells have been submitted to 48h treatment with diesel exhaust particles (25 g/ml and 50 g/ml, DEP50) or alternatively to 3h of CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose deprivation, followed by 1h of CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose restoration.
28400208	The combined treatment consisted in 48h of diesel exhaust particles (25 g/ml and 50 g/ml, DEP50) followed by 3h of CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose deprivation and 1h of restoration.
28400208	A panel of markers related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, such as transcription factors (GENE_4780_Nrf2 and GENE_3091_HIF_1a), anti-oxidant proteins (HO-1, GENE_6647_SOD_1, GENE_3308_Hsp70) and proteins potentially inducing further oxidative-stress or DISEASE_D007249_inflammation (GENE_1545_Cyp1b1, GENE_4843_iNOS, GENE_4513_COX_2, GENE_7124_TNF_a, GENE_3552_IL_1a, GENE_3553_IL_1b, GENE_3576_IL_8, GENE_7422_VEGF), have been examined.
28400208	Data obtained showed that diesel exhaust particles and CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose deprivation treatments alone elicited the antioxidants response, each by means of a different transcription factor, while the combined treatment led to a dysregulation of the antioxidant response during DISEASE_D007511_ischemic_injury reperfusion.

28407500	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a widely used chemical that has been extensively studied as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC).
28407500	Other CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols sharing close structural features with CHEMICAL__BPA, are increasingly being used as alternatives, increasing the need to assess associated hazards to the endocrine system.
28407500	In the present study, the estrogenic activity of CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS) and CHEMICAL__bisphenol_F (CHEMICAL__BPF) was assessed by using a combination of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish-specific mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo assays.
28407500	The three CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols were found to efficiently transactivate all SPECIES_7955_zebrafish CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor (zfER) subtypes in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish hepatic reporter cell lines (ZELH-zfERs).
28407500	CHEMICAL__BPA was selective for zfERa while CHEMICAL__BPS and CHEMICAL__BPF were slightly more potent on zfERb subtypes.
28407500	We further documented the estrogenic effect in vivo by quantifying the expression of GENE_7955)_brain_aromatase using a transgenic GENE_7955)_cyp19a1b-GFP SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryo assay.
28407500	All three CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols induced GFP in a concentration-dependent manner.
28407500	CHEMICAL__BPS only partially induced GENE_7955)_brain_aromatase at the highest tested concentrations (>30  M) while CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__BPF strongly induced GFP, in an ER-dependent manner, at 1-10  M. Furthermore, we show that CHEMICAL__BPF strongly induced vitellogenin synthesis in adult male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28407500	Overall, this study demonstrates the estrogenic activity of CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPF and CHEMICAL__BPS in different cell- and tissue-contexts and at different stages of development.
28407500	Differences between in vitro and in vivo responses are discussed in light of selective ER activation and the fate of the compounds in the models.
28407500	This study confirms the relevance of combining cellular and whole-organism bioassays in a unique model species for the hazard assessment of candidate EDCs.
28407592	Different effects of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_a and its halogenated derivatives on the reproduction and development of SPECIES_30732_Oryzias_melastigma under environmentally relevant doses.
28407592	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and its halogenated compounds (CHEMICAL_D006859_H-CHEMICAL__BPAs) are widely detected in the environmental media and organisms.
28407592	However, their toxicological effects, especially chronic exposure at low doses, have not been fully compared.
28407592	In this study, the effects of CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__H_BPAs on the reproduction and development of SPECIES_30732_Oryzias_melastigma were systematically assessed and compared at various developmental stages.
28407592	CHEMICAL__BPA and its derivatives CHEMICAL_C020806_tetrabromobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TBBPA) and CHEMICAL_C041181_tetrachlorobisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__TCBPA) elicited the acceleration of embryonic heartbeat.
28407592	CHEMICAL__BPA did not show any significant impact on the hatching time and rate of embryos.
28407592	In contrast, both CHEMICAL__TBBPA and CHEMICAL__TCBPA led to the delayed hatching and decreased hatching rate.
28407592	Accordingly, the expressions of hatching enzyme significantly decreased upon exposure and CHEMICAL__TCBPA was found to be more toxic than CHEMICAL__TBBPA.
28407592	The body weight and gonadsomatic index (GSI) of the treated fish were relatively lower than the control fish upon long-term (four months from larvae to adult) exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA rather than H-CHEMICAL__BPAs.
28407592	Slowed oocyte development occurred in the ovary, and the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen level decreased after exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA rather than H-CHEMICAL__BPAs.
28407592	In male fish, no significant alteration was observed in the testis for all groups.
28407592	The concentration of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone significantly decreased upon exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA rather than H-CHEMICAL__BPAs.
28407592	The effects of these three chemicals on the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-related gene expressions were different under various developmental stages.
28407592	Our study indicated the importance of considering both the exposure stages and structure-activity relationship when assessing the eco-toxicological impact of pollutants.
28412091	CHEMICAL_D064747_Lansoprazole halts contrast induced DISEASE_D007674_nephropathy through activation of GENE_10116)_Nrf2 pathway in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28412091	DISEASE_D007674_Contrast_induced_nephropathy (DISEASE_D007674_CIN) is an important cause of DISEASE_D058186_acute_kidney_injury characterized by significant mortality and morbidity.
28412091	To date, there is no successful protective regimen for DISEASE_D007674_CIN especially in poor kidney function SPECIES_9606_patients.
28412091	CHEMICAL_D064747_Lansoprazole has been shown to exert antioxidant action through induction of GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2 (GENE_4780_Nrf2) pathway.
28412091	The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential of CHEMICAL_D064747_lansoprazole to activate GENE_4780_Nrf2 pathway in the kidney and consequently to protect against oxidative stress induced by iodinated contrast media.
28412091	CHEMICAL_D064747_Lansoprazole, at a dose of 100  mg/kg, showed a significant induction of GENE_4780_Nrf2 mRNA after 3  h. Administration of contrast media induced significant increase in serum CHEMICAL_D003404_creatinine and blood CHEMICAL__urea_nitrogen, histological deterioration, and reduction in total antioxidant capacity.
28412091	Moreover, it instigated the defensive GENE_4780_Nrf2 gene expression and immunoreactivity.
28412091	In addition, there were overexpression of GENE_3162_HO_1, GENE_836_caspase_3, GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_3569_IL6 genes and downregulation of GENE_596_Bcl2 gene.
28412091	Pre-treatment with CHEMICAL_D064747_lansoprazole (100  mg/kg) ameliorated the nephrotoxicity parameters and oxidative stress, improved histological lesions, and hijacked apoptotic and inflammatory markers that were provoked by contrast media.
28412091	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_D064747_lansoprazole attenuates experimental DISEASE_D007674_CIN which might be due to activation of GENE_4780_Nrf2 antioxidant defence pathway.
28412091	These findings highlight the potential benefit of incorporating CHEMICAL_D064747_lansoprazole in the protective regimen against DISEASE_D007674_CIN especially for susceptible SPECIES_9606_patients.
28412506	Long-term di CHEMICAL_17243__2_ethylhexyl_phthalate exposure promotes proliferation and survival of HepG2 cells via activation of NFkB.
28412506	CHEMICAL_D004051_Di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used plasticizer.
28412506	DEHP can easily leach out from products into the environment and has become a significant environmental contamination.
28412506	However, its carcinogenic effects in SPECIES_9606_human remain controversial.
28412506	In this study, we exposed DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma HepG2 cells to different concentrations of DEHP for a period of times, followed by a combination of RNA-seq analysis and molecular analysis for DEHP-altered genes.
28412506	We observed that long-term and very low-dose DEHP treatment has growth-inducing activity in HepG2 cells, while short-term and high-dose DEHP treatment has little effects on DISEASE_D009369_tumor cell proliferation.
28412506	Bioinformatic analysis further revealed that a large subset of differentially expressed genes affected by DEHP have functional annotations related to DISEASE_D007249_inflammation response.
28412506	Importantly we found that long-term DEHP treatment stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-k B) activity in HepG2 cells, while inhibition of NFkB activity could offset the effects of DEHP exposure.
28412506	In conclusion, continuous DEHP treatment could promote proliferation of HepG2 cells via activating NFkB signaling pathway.
28412507	Transcriptomic analyses of SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B exposed to atmospheric fine particulate matter PM2.5.
28412507	Respiratory exposure is the major route of atmospheric PM2.5 entering the SPECIES_9606_human body.
28412507	Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased risk of DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain less clear.
28412507	In this study, SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were used to investigate the toxic effect and gene expression changes induced by PM2.5 collected from Beijing, China, based on microarray and following bioinformatic analyses.
28412507	Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that PM2.5 caused significant changes in gene expression patterns related to a series of important functions, covering gene transcription, signal transduction, cell proliferation, cellular metabolic processes, immune response, etc.
28412507	Additionally, pathway analysis and signal-net analysis showed that PI3K/GENE_207_Akt, MAPK, and TNF signaling pathways were the most prominently significant pathways affected by PM2.5, which play key roles in regulating cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cytoskeleton regulation, and inflammatory response.
28412507	Finally, for the purpose of verifing the accuracy of microarray analysis, qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of part key genes in the above signaling pathways, which were selected from the signal-net.
28412507	Our study provided a large amount of information on the molecular mechanism that underling PM2.5 caused DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_diseases, and follow-up researches are still needed for further exploration.
28412508	CHEMICAL__Methyl_5_1H_indol_3_yl_selanyl_1H_benzoimidazol_2_ylcarbamate (M-24), a novel tubulin inhibitor, causes G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis by disrupting tubulin polymerization in SPECIES_9606_human cervical and DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28412508	CHEMICAL__Methyl_5_1H_indol_3_yl_selanyl_1H_benzoimidazol_2_ylcarbamate (M-24) is a newly synthesized analogue of CHEMICAL_D015739_nocodazole by our group and has been found to be active for some DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells.
28412508	However, its sensitivity to different cell lines and the underlying anticancer mechanism are still unclear.
28412508	In this study, we proved that M-24 had strong time- and dose-dependent anti-proliferative effects on SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D009369_cervical_cancer HeLa cells and SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_carcinoma MCF-7 cells.
28412508	We demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effects of M-24 in both cell lines were associated with microtubule depolymerization.
28412508	Furthermore, M-24 treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner with subsequent apoptosis induction.
28412508	Western blotting analysis revealed that up-regulation of GENE_891_cyclin_B1 and GENE_983_cdc2 was related with G2/M arrest in both cell lines.
28412508	In addition, M-24-induced HeLa cell apoptosis was mainly associated with mitochondria-dependent intrinsic pathway.
28412508	However, M-24-induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis was associated with both mitochondrial and death receptor pathway.
28412508	In conclusion, M-24 caused apoptosis through disrupting microtubule assembly and inducing cell cycle arrest in HeLa and MCF-7 cells.
28412508	Therefore, the novel compound M-24 is a promising microtubule-destabilizing agent that has great potential for the therapy of various DISEASE_D001943_malignancies_especially_human_cervical_and_breast_cancers.
28414027	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic activates the expression of 3b-HSD in SPECIES_10090_mouse Leydig cells through repression of histone H3K9 methylation.
28414027	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic exposure has been associated with male reproductive dysfunction by disrupting steroidogenesis; however, the roles of epigenetic drivers, especially histone methylation in CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced DISEASE_D064420_steroidogenic_toxicity remain not well documented.
28414027	In this study, we investigated the role of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation in steroidogenesis disturbance in SPECIES_10090_mouse Leydig cells (MLTC-1) due to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure.
28414027	Our results indicated that mRNA and protein expression levels of CHEMICAL__3b_hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-HSD) were both significantly up-regulated while the rest of key genes involved in steroidogenesis were down-regulated.
28414027	Moreover, CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure significantly decreased the histone H3K9 di- and tri-methylation (H3K9SPECIES_10090_me2/3) levels in SPECIES_10090_MLTC_1 cells.
28414027	Since H3K9 demethylation leads to gene activation, we further investigated whether the induction of 3b-HSD expression was ascribed to reduced H3K9 methylation.
28414027	The results showed that H3K9me2/3 demethylase (GENE_10090)_JMJD2A) inhibitor, CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin (CHEMICAL__Que) significantly attenuated the decrease of H3K9me2/3 and increase of 3b-HSD expression induced by CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic.
28414027	To further elucidate the mechanism for the activation of 3b-HSD, we determined the histone H3K9 methylation levels in GENE_10090)_Hsd3b gene promoter, which also showed significant decrease of H3K9me2/3 in the investigated region after CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure.
28414027	Considering these results, we conclude that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure induced 3b-HSD up-regulation by suppressing H3K9me2/3 status, which is suggested as a compensatory mechanism for steroidogenic disturbance in SPECIES_10090_MLTC_1 cells.
28414124	Roles of piRNAs in CHEMICAL__microcystin_leucine_arginine (CHEMICAL__MC_LR) induced reproductive DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in testis on male offspring.
28414124	In the present study, we evaluated the toxic effects on the testis of the male offspring of CHEMICAL__MC_LR exposure during fetal and lactational periods.
28414124	Pregnant females were distributed into two experimental groups: control group and CHEMICAL__MC_LR group which were exposed to 0 and 10   g/L of CHEMICAL__MC_LR, respectively, through drinking water separately during fetal and lactational periods.
28414124	At the age of 30 days after birth, the male offspring were euthanized.
28414124	The body weight, testis index, and histomorphology change were observed and the global changes of piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) expression were evaluated.
28414124	The results revealed that CHEMICAL__MC_LR was found in the testis of male offspring, body weight and testis index decreased significantly, and testicular tissue structure was damaged in the CHEMICAL__MC_LR group.
28414124	In addition, the exposure to CHEMICAL__MC_LR resulted in an altered piRNA expression profile and an increase of the cell apoptosis and a decrease of the cell proliferation in the testis of the male offspring.
28414124	It was reasonable to speculate that the toxic effects on reproductive system of the male offspring in CHEMICAL__MC_LR group might be mediated by piRNAs through the regulation of the target genes.
28414124	As far as we are aware, this is the first report showing that CHEMICAL__MC_LR could play a role in disorder of proliferative and cell apoptosis in the testis of the male offspring by the maternal transmission effect of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28414158	CHEMICAL_D008727_Methotrexate hepatotoxicity is associated with oxidative stress, and down-regulation of PPARy and GENE_10116)_Nrf2: Protective effect of CHEMICAL__18b_Glycyrrhetinic_acid.
28414158	CHEMICAL__18b_glycyrrhetinic_acid (CHEMICAL__18b_GA) is a bioactive component of licorice with promising hepatoprotective activity.
28414158	However, its protective mechanism on CHEMICAL_D008727_methotrexate (CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX) hepatotoxicity in not well defined.
28414158	We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of CHEMICAL__18b_GA, pointing to the role of GENE_10116)_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_gamma (PPARy) and the redox-sensitive nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (GENE_10116)_Nrf2).
28414158	SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were orally administered CHEMICAL__18b_GA (50 and 100  mg/kg) 7 days either before or after CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX injection.
28414158	CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX induced significant increase in circulating liver function marker enzymes and CHEMICAL_D001663_bilirubin with concomitant declined albumin levels.
28414158	Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, and liver CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde and CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide were significantly increased in CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced SPECIES_10116_rats.
28414158	Treatment with CHEMICAL__18b_GA significantly reduced serum enzymes of liver function, CHEMICAL_D001663_bilirubin and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
28414158	CHEMICAL__18b_GA attenuated CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced oxidative stress and restored the antioxidant defenses.
28414158	In addition, CHEMICAL__18b_GA improved liver histological structure and decreased the expression of GENE_10116)_Bax whereas increased GENE_10116)_Bcl_2 expression.
28414158	CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced SPECIES_10116_rats showed significant down-regulation of GENE_10116)_Nrf2, hemoxygenase-1 and PPARy, an effect that was markedly reversed by CHEMICAL__18b_GA supplemented either before or after CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX.
28414158	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__18b_GA protected against CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury, possibly by activating GENE_10116)_Nrf2 and PPARy, and subsequent attenuation of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.
28414158	Therefore, CHEMICAL__18b_GA can provide protection against CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced hepatotoxicity.
28412309	The scaffold protein GENE_10399_RACK1 is a target of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with important implication in immunity.
28412309	We recently demonstrated the existence of a complex hormonal balance between CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormones in the control of GENE_10399_RACK1 (GENE_10399_Receptor_for_Activated_C_Kinase_1) expression and immune activation, suggesting that this scaffold protein may also be targeted by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).
28412309	As a proof of concept, we investigated the effect of the doping agent CHEMICAL_D009277_nandrolone, an GENE_367_androgen_receptor (GENE_367_AR) agonist, and of CHEMICAL_D003634_p_p_DDT (CHEMICAL_16130_dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and its main metabolite CHEMICAL_D003633_p_p_DDE (CHEMICAL_D003633_dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), a weak and strong GENE_367_AR antagonist, respectively, on GENE_10399_RACK1 expression and innate immune response.
28412309	In analogy to endogenous CHEMICAL_D000728_androgens, CHEMICAL_D009277_nandrolone induced a dose-related increase in GENE_10399_RACK1 transcriptional activity and protein expression, resulting in increased LPS-induced GENE_3576_IL_8 and GENE_7124_TNF_a production and proliferation in THP-1 cells.
28412309	Conversely, CHEMICAL_D003634_p_p_DDT and CHEMICAL_D003633_p_p_DDE significantly decrease GENE_10399_RACK1 expression, LPS-induced cytokine production and GENE_942_CD86 expression; with CHEMICAL_D003633_p_p_DDE exerting a stronger repressor effect than CHEMICAL_D003634_p_p_DDT, consistent with its stronger GENE_367_AR antagonistic effect.
28412309	These results indicate that GENE_10399_RACK1 could be a relevant target of EDCs, responding in opposite ways to agonist or antagonist of GENE_367_AR, representing a bridge between the endocrine system and the innate immune system.
28412504	Endotoxin induced TLR4 signaling downregulates CYP19A1 expression through CHEMICAL__CEBPB in buffalo granulosa cells.
28412504	CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen is essential for growth and development of ovarian follicles.
28412504	Infections associated with SPECIES_562_E_coli or Endotoxin (DISEASE_C536528_LPS) suppress CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol production by the downregulation of CYP19A1 expression.
28412504	However, the molecular mechanism of its down regulation is not yet known.
28412504	To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of DISEASE_C536528_LPS-mediated downregulation of CYP19A1 gene expression, we studied the effect of DISEASE_C536528_LPS and TLR4 signaling pathway inhibitor (OxPAPC, OxPAPC-Oxidized CHEMICAL_73003_1_palmitoyl_2_arachidonoyl_sn_glycero_3_phosphocholine) on CYP19A1 expression, and expression of CHEMICAL__CEBPB and CHEMICAL__CEBPB binding on CYP19A1 proximal promoter (CYP19A1 PII) in buffalo granulosa cells in vitro.
28412504	The results showed that DISEASE_C536528_LPS (1 g/ml) significantly declined the expression of CYP19A1 gene.
28412504	In further experiments, inhibitor studies confirmed the involvement of TLR4 in DISEASE_C536528_LPS induced CYP19A1 gene down regulation in buffalo granulosa cells.
28412504	DISEASE_C536528_LPS promoted higher levels of CHEMICAL__CEBPB at cellular and nuclear level in granulosa cells.
28412504	Chromatin immunoprecipitation results showed, that DISEASE_C536528_LPS induces higher amount of CHEMICAL__CEBPB binding on the CYP19A1 PII.
28412504	Further, TLR4 inhibitor attenuated the DISEASE_C536528_LPS induced implications.
28412504	In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CHEMICAL__CEBPB could be a potential regulator for DISEASE_C536528_LPS mediated downregulation of CYP19A1 and decline of CHEMICAL_D004958_17_beta_estradiol levels in buffalo granulosa cells.
28414026	Targeting GENE_10090)_Oct2 and GENE_10090)_P53: CHEMICAL_C007768_Formononetin prevents CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced DISEASE_D058186_acute_kidney_injury.
28414026	Nephrotoxicity is one of major side effects of CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin in chemotherapy.
28414026	Therefore, there is an urgent medical need to develop drugs that may protect kidney from DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28414026	In previous study, we found that it showed the protective effects of CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin against apoptosis by upregulating GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28414026	In this study, we investigated the renoprotective effect of CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin against CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced AKI and tried to elucidate the possible mechanisms.
28414026	The amelioration of renal function, histopathological changes, and apoptosis in tubular cells was observed after CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin treatment.
28414026	CHEMICAL_C007768_Formononetin decreased expression of GENE_10090)_organic_cation_transporter_2 (GENE_10090)_Oct2) and increased the expressions of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (Mrps), which might result in a decrease accumulation of CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin in tubular cells after AKI.
28414026	CHEMICAL_D001973_5_Bromo_2_deoxyuridine (CHEMICAL_D001973_BrdU) and Ki-67 staining assay indicated that CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin could promote the renal tubular cells proliferation after CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin nephrotoxicity.
28414026	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin regulated cyclins and pro-apoptotic proteins to involve the regulation of cell cycle.
28414026	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin decreased GENE_10090)_p53 expression via promoting the overexpression of SPECIES_10090_murine double minute 2 (GENE_10090)_MDM2) and GENE_10090)_MDMX.
28414026	Taken together, CHEMICAL_C007768_formononetin provided protective effects by promoting proliferation of surviving renal tubular cells and inhibiting apoptosis after CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-induced AKI.
28414160	CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat induces extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in A549 cells by induction of GENE_8795_DR5 and repression of anti-apoptotic proteins, GENE_1654_DDX3 and GSK3 expression.
28414160	CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat (PQ) is a CHEMICAL_D015082_bipyridyl derivative herbicide known to cause DISEASE_D008171_lung_toxicity partly through induction of apoptosis.
28414160	Here we demonstrated that PQ caused apoptosis in A549 cells.
28414160	PQ increased cleavage of GENE_841_caspase_8 and GENE_637_Bid, indicating GENE_841_caspase_8 activation and truncated GENE_637_Bid, the two key mediators of extrinsic apoptosis.
28414160	Additionally, PQ treatment caused an increase in GENE_8795_DR5 (GENE_8795_death_receptor_5) and GENE_841_caspase_8 interaction, indicating formation of DISC (death-inducing signaling complex).
28414160	These results indicate that PQ induces apoptosis through extrinsic pathway in A549 cells.
28414160	Moreover, PQ drastically increased GENE_8795_DR5 expression and membrane localization.
28414160	Furthermore, PQ caused prominent concentration dependent reductions of GENE_1654_DDX3 (the GENE_1654_DEAD_box_protein_3) and GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3) which can associate with GENE_8795_DR5 and prevent DISC formation.
28414160	Additionally, PQ decreased GENE_8795_DR5-GENE_1654_DDX3 interaction, suggesting a reduction of GENE_1654_DDX3/GSK3 anti-apoptotic complex.
28414160	Inhibition of GSK3, which is known to promote extrinsic apoptosis by its pharmacological inhibitor, CHEMICAL__BIO accentuated PQ-induced apoptosis.
28414160	Moreover, GSK3 inhibition caused a further decrease in PQ-reduced GENE_8795_DR5-GENE_1654_DDX3 interaction.
28414160	Taken together, these results suggest that PQ may induce extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in A549 cells through upregulation of GENE_8795_DR5 and repression of anti-apoptotic proteins, GENE_1654_DDX3/GSK3 leading to reduction of anti-apoptotic complex.
28416457	CHEMICAL_C016599_Mono_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate inhibits SPECIES_9606_human extravillous trophoblast invasion via the PPARy pathway.
28416457	Concerns over the adverse reproductive outcomes in SPECIES_9606_human have been raised, more evidence including the underlying mechanism are required.
28416457	Since extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion is an important physiological step during early development, the effects of CHEMICAL_C016599_mono_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_C016599_MEHP), the bioactive metabolite of CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP, on EVT invasion were investigated using Matrigel-coated transwell chambers and cell line HTR-8/SVneo.
28416457	In the transwell-based invasive assay, CHEMICAL_C016599_MEHP exposure inhibited EVT invasion as judged by decreased invasion index.
28416457	Further analysis showed that CHEMICAL_C016599_MEHP exposure significantly inhibited the activity of GENE_4318_matrix_metalloproteinase_9 (GENE_4318_MMP_9), which is an important positive regulator of EVT invasion.
28416457	Meanwhile, the protein levels of GENE_7076_tissue_inhibitor_matrix_metalloproteinase_1 (GENE_7076_TIMP_1), one key negative regulator of EVT invasion, were upregulated by CHEMICAL_C016599_MEHP treatment.
28416457	Finally, inactivation of PPARy pathway by either PPARy inhibitors or PPARy shRNA knockdown rescued the CHEMICAL_C016599_MEHP-induced inhibited invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells, which is accompanied by the recovery of inhibited GENE_4318_MMP_9 expression.
28416457	The present study provides the evidence that CHEMICAL_C016599_MEHP exposure inhibits trophoblast invasion via PPARy at concentrations comparable to those found in SPECIES_9606_humans, which provides an insight in understanding the mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP-associated early DISEASE_D034381_pregnancy_loss.
28419827	Antihyperglycemic, antioxidant activities of tucum   oil (Astrocaryum vulgare) in CHEMICAL_D000496_alloxan-induced DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10090_mice, and identification of CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid profile by gas chromatograph: New natural source to treat DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia.
28419827	The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the oral administration of tucum   oil (Astrocaryum vulgare) on CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and insulin levels, oxidative status, and pancreatic genotoxic parameters of CHEMICAL_D000496_alloxan-induced DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10090_mice.
28419827	The animals were divided into four groups (n  =  6 each): control/water; control/tucum   oil; DISEASE_D003920_diabetic/water; DISEASE_D003920_diabetic/tucum   oil treated for 14 days with 5.0  mL  kg(-1) via oral gavage.
28419827	Gas chromatograph characterization demonstrated that oleic/elaidic CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid is the most abundant component present in this oil, followed by CHEMICAL__palmitic_and_stearic_fatty_acids.
28419827	Our results demonstrated an increase (p  <  0.05) in water and food intake, blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, CHEMICAL_C029684_thiobarbituric_acid reactive species (TBARS) levels, damage index, and frequency of damage; conversely body weight, insulin levels, catalase (CAT) and CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and cell viability were decreased in the DISEASE_D003920_diabetic/water group compared to the control/water group.
28419827	The treatment with tucum   oil prevented these alterations in the DISEASE_D003920_diabetic/tucum   oil group compared to the DISEASE_D003920_diabetic/water group, and restored these parameters near to the control/water group.
28419827	In summary, our findings demonstrated that treatment with tucum   oil causes a hypoglycemic effect improving insulin levels and antioxidant/oxidant status, and has a protector effect against DISEASE_D010182_pancreatic_damage induced by oxidative stress in CHEMICAL_D000496_alloxan-induced DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10090_mice.
28419832	CHEMICAL_C472036_Dihydromyricetin modulates GENE_10090)_p62 and autophagy crosstalk with the GENE_10090)_Keap_1/GENE_10090)_Nrf2 pathway to alleviate CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol-induced DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_injury.
28419832	Increasing evidence has demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C472036_dihydromyricetin (CHEMICAL__DMY) contains highly effective antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-DISEASE_D003920_diabetic properties.
28419832	Nevertheless, the underlying hepatoprotective mechanisms of CHEMICAL__DMY have infrequently been reported thus far.
28419832	In the present study, C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice were fed with the Lieber-DeCarli diet containing CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol or isocaloric CHEMICAL_D008320_maltose dextrin as a control diet with or without CHEMICAL__DMY (75 and 150mg/kg/d bw) for 6 weeks.
28419832	CHEMICAL__DMY significantly attenuated hepatic enzyme release, hepatic lipid peroxidation and CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride deposition induced by chronic CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol exposure.
28419832	In addition, CHEMICAL__DMY dramatically attenuated the CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol-triggered elevation of the level of inflammatory cytokines and partially recovered hepatic pathological changes.
28419832	Notably, CHEMICAL__DMY remarkably modified aberrant expression of GENE_10090)_CYP2E1, GENE_10090)_Keap_1 and GENE_10090)_HO_1 in the liver and simultaneously ameliorated disordered nuclear localization of NF-kB and GENE_10090)_Nrf2 to exert its hepatoprotective effects.
28419832	Further mechanistic exploration suggested that CHEMICAL__DMY activated GENE_10090)_Nrf2, possibly mediated through the autophagy pathway.
28419832	Analysis of the crosstalk among GENE_10090)_p62, GENE_10090)_Keap_1 and GENE_10090)_Nrf2 demonstrated that the GENE_10090)_p62 upregulation caused by CHEMICAL__DMY contributes to a positive feedback loop in GENE_10090)_Nrf2 activation.
28419832	In summary, CHEMICAL__DMY likely modulates GENE_10090)_p62 and autophagy crosstalk with the GENE_10090)_Keap_1/GENE_10090)_Nrf2 pathway to alleviate DISEASE_D005234_liver_steatosis and the inflammatory response in the pathological progression of DISEASE_D000326_ALD.
28421967	DISEASE_D008175_Lung_Tumor Induction by 26-week Dermal Application of CHEMICAL_C024565_1_2_Dichloroethane in CB6F1-Tg rasH2 SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28421967	Short-term alternatives to traditional 2-year carcinogenic studies in rodents are being actively pursued.
28421967	Recently, a 26-week short-term carcinogenicity study using CB6F1-Tg rasH2@Jcl (rasH2) SPECIES_10090_mice has become a worldwide standard for the evaluation of DISEASE_D063646_chemical_carcinogenesis.
28421967	However, an acceptable short-term carcinogenic study model for dermally applied products is still lacking.
28421967	To investigate the suitability of using the rasH2 SPECIES_10090_mouse to test carcinogenic potential, CHEMICAL_C024565_1_2_dichloroethane (CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE) was dermally applied to rasH2 SPECIES_10090_mice: CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE is a known carcinogen that causes lung bronchiolo-alveolar DISEASE_D000236_adenomas and DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinomas when administered topically, orally, or by inhalation exposure; CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE at a dose level of 126 mg/SPECIES_10090_mouse in 200  l CHEMICAL_D000096_acetone or CHEMICAL_D000096_acetone alone (vehicle control) was applied to the dorsal skin of 10 SPECIES_10090_mice of each sex 3 times a week for 26 weeks.
28421967	As a positive control, 10 SPECIES_10090_mice of each sex received a single intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg of CHEMICAL__N_methyl- CHEMICAL__N_nitrosourea.
28421967	Bronchiolo-alveolar DISEASE_D000236_adenomas and DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinomas were significantly increased in CHEMICAL_27789_1_2_DCE-treated rasH2 SPECIES_10090_mice of both sexes, and DISEASE_D002282_bronchiolo_alveolar_hyperplasias were significantly increased in female SPECIES_10090_mice.
28421967	Overall, almost all SPECIES_10090_mice of each sex developed DISEASE_D000236_adenomas and/or DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinomas with 100% of female rasH2 SPECIES_10090_mice developing DISEASE_D002282_bronchiolo_alveolar_adenocarcinomas.
28426875	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A activates GENE_1956_EGFR and ERK promoting proliferation, DISEASE_D009369_tumor spheroid formation and resistance to GENE_1956_EGFR pathway inhibition in GENE_2099_estrogen_receptor-negative DISEASE_D001943_inflammatory_breast_cancer cells.
28426875	Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a link between environmental chemical exposure and progression of aggressive DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer subtypes.
28426875	Of all clinically distinct types of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancers, the most lethal phenotypic variant is DISEASE_D001943_inflammatory_breast_cancer (DISEASE_D001943_IBC).
28426875	Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (GENE_1956_EGFR/GENE_2064_HER2) along with GENE_2099_estrogen_receptor (GENE_2099_ER) negativity is common in DISEASE_D001943_IBC DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells, which instead of a solid mass present as rapidly proliferating DISEASE_D009369_diffuse_tumor cell clusters.
28426875	Our previous studies have demonstrated a role of an adaptive response of increased antioxidants in acquired resistance to GENE_1956_EGFR-targeting drugs in DISEASE_D001943_IBC.
28426875	Environmental chemicals are known to induce oxidative stress resulting in perturbations in signal transduction pathways.
28426875	It is therefore of interest to identify chemicals that can potentiate GENE_1956_EGFR mitogenic effects in DISEASE_D001943_IBC.
28426875	Herein, we assessed in GENE_2099_ER-negative DISEASE_D001943_IBC cells a subset of chemicals from the EPA ToxCast set for their effect on GENE_1956_EGFR activation and in DISEASE_D009369_multiple_cancer phenotypic assays.
28426875	We demonstrated that endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and CHEMICAL_C404910_2_2_bis_p_hydroxyphenyl_1_1_1_trichloroethane can increase GENE_1956_EGFR/ERK signaling.
28426875	CHEMICAL__BPA also caused a corresponding increase in expression of GENE_6647_SOD1 and anti-apoptotic GENE_596_Bcl_2, key markers of antioxidant and anti-apoptotic processes.
28426875	CHEMICAL__BPA potentiated clonogenic growth and DISEASE_D009369_tumor spheroid formation in vitro, reflecting DISEASE_D001943_IBC-specific pathological characteristics.
28426875	Furthermore, we identified that CHEMICAL__BPA was able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of an GENE_1956_EGFR targeted drug in a longer-term anchorage-independent growth assay.
28426875	These findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for environmental chemicals such as CHEMICAL__BPA in potentiating a hyperproliferative and death-resistant phenotype in DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells by activating mitogenic pathways to which the DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells are addicted for survival.
28428137	JWA antagonizes CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity via activation of GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28428137	CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat (PQ), a widely used environmental toxin in agriculture, contributes to the onset and progression of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) by damaging neurons.
28428137	The JWA gene, also known as GENE_10090)_ARL6IP5, exerts a protective effect on degenerating CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine (DA) neurons.
28428137	However, the roles of JWA in PQ-induced DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_damage are still unknown.
28428137	In our study, two neuronal cell lines (HT-22 and SH-SY5Y) and neuron-specific JWA knockout (JWA-nKO) and age-matched wild-type (JWA-nWT) SPECIES_10090_mice were subjected to PQ treatment.
28428137	The results indicate that PQ administration triggers the upregulation of JWA.
28428137	Elevated expression of JWA rescues the accumulation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) while increasing CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH) and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels under PQ exposure.
28428137	Further investigations revealed that the protective effect of CHEMICAL__JWA mostly involves regulation of the GENE_10090)_MEK/GENE_18708;18024_PI3K_Nrf2 axis.
28428137	Our results suggest that JWA may be a novel target for the prevention and treatment of PQ-induced DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28430709	CHEMICAL_D002762_Vitamin_D3 repressed astrocyte activation following lipopolysaccharide stimulation in vitro and in neonatal SPECIES_10116_rats.
28430709	CHEMICAL_D002762_Vitamin_D3 has been reported to be an immunity modulator and high levels of CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 are correlated with a decreased risk for developing DISEASE_D020279_diseases_in_the_central_nervous_system.
28430709	Astrocytes are important immune cells and contribute toward DISEASE_D007249_inflammation during DISEASE_D009422_neurological_diseases.
28430709	The GENE_7421_vitamin_D_receptor has been reported to be expressed in astrocytes; however, the effect of CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 on astrocyte activation has not been studied.
28430709	Here, we found that lipopolysaccharide stimulation in astrocytes could enhance the expression of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D receptor and GENE_1594_Cyp27B1, which encodes the enzyme for converting CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 into its active form.
28430709	CHEMICAL_D002762_Vitamin_D3 suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumour DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor-a, GENE_3553_interleukin_1b, GENE_7422_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor, and also GENE_7099_TLR4 in activated astrocytes.
28430709	Astrocyte activation was further found to be suppressed after the administration of CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 in neonatal SPECIES_10116_rats injected with lipopolysaccharide in vivo.
28430709	We demonstrated the antiactivation effect of CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 in astrocytes after lipopolysaccharide stimulation.
28430709	Considering the function of reactive astrocytes in augmenting inflammatory response in DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration and DISEASE_D020214_brain_injury, the finding that CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 administration may inhibit astrocyte activation may be potentially useful for the treatment of DISEASE_D020279_central_nervous_system_disorders.
28428136	CHEMICAL_C013015_Hesperetin derivative-14 alleviates DISEASE_D007249_inflammation by activating GENE_10090)_PPAR-y in SPECIES_10090_mice with GENE_10090)_CCl4-induced DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury and LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells.
28428136	CHEMICAL_C013015_Hesperetin is a CHEMICAL_72730_flavanone_glycoside compound naturally occurring in the fruit peel of Citrusaurantium L. (Rutaceae).
28428136	Previous studies revealed that CHEMICAL_C013015_hesperetin possesses various pharmacological effects, including anti-DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective properties.
28428136	CHEMICAL_C013015_Hesperetin derivative-14 (DISEASE_D006816_HD-14) is a derivative of CHEMICAL_C013015_hesperetin improved in water solubility and bioavailability.
28428136	In this study, we indicated that DISEASE_D006816_HD-14 (2 M) significantly DISEASE_D007249_attenuated_inflammation in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, besides, DISEASE_D006816_HD-14 (100mg/kg) exhibited hepato-protective effects and anti-inflammatory effects on C57BL/6J SPECIES_10090_mice with GENE_10090)_CCl4-induced DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury.
28428136	In addition, it was demonstrated that DISEASE_D006816_HD-14 dramatically up-regulated the expression of GENE_10090)_PPAR-y in vivo and in vitro.
28428136	Interestingly, over-expression of GENE_10090)_PPAR-y had anti-inflammatory effects on the expressions of GENE_10090)_TNF_a, GENE_10090)_IL_6, and GENE_10090)_IL_1b, whereas, knockdown of GENE_10090)_PPAR-y with small interfering RNA had pro-inflammatory effects in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells.
28428136	Thus, our findings demonstrated that DISEASE_D007249_HD_14_alleviated_inflammation by activating GENE_10090)_PPAR-y expression at least in part.
28428136	Further studies founded that DISEASE_D006816_HD-14 remarkably inhibited the expression of p-GENE_10090)_JAK1 and p-GENE_10090)_STAT1 through up-regulating GENE_10090)_PPAR-y.
28428136	Together, these results suggested that DISEASE_D006816_HD-14 served as an activator of GENE_10090)_PPAR-y and the GENE_10090)_JAK1/GENE_10090)_STAT1 signaling pathway may be involved in the progress of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28428136	Collectively, DISEASE_D006816_HD-14 may be utilized as a potential anti-DISEASE_D007249_inflammation monomeric compound in the treatment of DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury.
28431985	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin interferes with the fluid volume and receptivity development of the uterus in SPECIES_10116_rats during the peri-implantation period.
28431985	HYPOTHESIS: CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin could induce changes to the fluid volume and receptivity development of the uterus during peri-implantation period.
28431985	METHODS: Female SPECIES_10116_rats were treated with CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin (10, 25 and 50mg/kg/day) subcutaneously beginning from day-1 pregnancy.
28431985	Uterus was harvested at day-4 (following three days CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin treatment) for morphological, ultra-structural, protein and mRNA expressional changes and plasma sex-CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid levels analyses.
28431985	In another cohort of SPECIES_10116_rats, implantation rate was determined at day-6 (following five days CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin treatment).
28431985	RESULTS: Administration of 50mg/kg/day CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin causes increased in uterine fluid volume and GENE_10116)_CFTR expression but decreased in y-ENaC, GENE_10116)_AQP_5, GENE_10116)_AQP_9 GENE_10116)_claudin_4, GENE_10116)_occludin, GENE_10116)_E_cadherin, integrin anb  , FGF, GENE_10116)_Ihh and GENE_10116)_Msx_1expression in the uterus.
28431985	Pinopodes were poorly develop, tight junctions appear less complex and implantation rate decreased.
28431985	Serum CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol levels increased but serum CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone levels decreased.
28431985	CONCLUSIONS: Interference in the fluid volume and receptivity development of the uterus during peri-implantation period by CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin could adversely affect SPECIES_6239_embryo implantation.
28433809	Biocorona formation on gold nanoparticles modulates SPECIES_9606_human proximal tubule kidney cell uptake, DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and gene expression.
28433809	Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) adsorb macromolecules to form a protein corona (PC) after systemic delivery, to which the kidney as the primary excretory organ is constantly exposed.
28433809	The role of the PC on AuNP cell uptake and DISEASE_D064420_toxicity was investigated in vitro in SPECIES_9606_human proximal tubule cells (HPTC) using 40 and 80nm branched CHEMICAL_D011094_polyethylenimine (BPEI), CHEMICAL_D008063_lipoic_acid (LA) and CHEMICAL_D011092_polyethylene_glycol (CHEMICAL_46793_PEG) coated AuNP with or without (bare) PCs composed of SPECIES_9606_human plasma (HP) or human serum albumin (HSA) for 0.25 to 24h.
28433809	Time-dependent intracellular uptake, assessed by ICP-MS showed PC modulated cell uptake and DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity; with bare 40nm BPEI-AuNP showing the greatest responses.
28433809	All AuNP showed minimal to no cytokine release.
28433809	At the nontoxic dose, 40nm bare BPEI-AuNP significantly modified gene expression related to immunotoxicity, DISEASE_D005234_steatosis, and mitochondrial metabolism; while at the high dose, pathways of DNA damage and repair, apoptosis, CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid metabolism and heat shock response were modulated.
28433809	HP corona BPEI-AuNP response was comparable to control.
28433809	These studies clearly showed reduced uptake and DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, as well as differentiated gene expression of AuNP with PCs, questioning the utility of in vitro studies using bare NP to assess in vivo effects.
28433809	Significantly, only cationic bare BPEI-AuNP had HPTC uptake or DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity suggesting the relative safety of CHEMICAL_46793_PEG and LA-AuNP as nanomedicine constructs.
28433925	Low-dose pollutant mixture triggers metabolic disturbances in female SPECIES_10090_mice leading to common and specific features as compared to a high-fat diet.
28433925	Environmental pollutants are potential etiologic factors of DISEASE_D009765_obesity and DISEASE_D003920_diabetes that DISEASE_D004671_reach_epidemic proportions worldwide.
28433925	However, it is important to determine if pollutants could exert metabolic defects without directly inducing DISEASE_D009765_obesity.
28433925	The metabolic disturbances triggered in nonobese SPECIES_10090_mice lifelong exposed to a mixture of low-dose pollutants (CHEMICAL__2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxine, CHEMICAL__polychlorinated_biphenyl_153, CHEMICAL_D004051_diethylhexyl_phthalate, and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A) were compared with changes provoked by a high-fat high-CHEMICAL_D013395_sucrose (HFHS) diet not containing the pollutant mixture.
28433925	Interestingly, females exposed to pollutants exhibited modifications in lipid homeostasis including a significant increase of hepatic CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides but also distinct features from those observed in diet-induced DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10090_mice.
28433925	For example, they did not gain weight nor was CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance impacted.
28433925	To get more insight, a transcriptomic analysis was performed in liver for comparison.
28433925	We observed that in addition to the xenobiotic/drug metabolism pathway, analysis of the hepatic signature illustrated that the CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid/CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol, CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid/lipid and circadian clock metabolic pathways were targeted in response to pollutants as observed in the diet-induced DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10090_mice.
28433925	However, the specific sets of dysregulated annotated genes (>1300) did not overlap more than 40% between both challenges with some genes specifically altered only in response to pollutant exposure.
28433925	Collectively, results show that pollutants and HFHS affect common metabolic pathways, but by different, albeit overlapping, mechanisms.
28433925	This is highly relevant for understanding the synergistic effects between pollutants and the obesogenic diet reported in the literature.
28435131	Repression of CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity by a combination of CHEMICAL_C050414_celastrol and CHEMICAL_C004692_brilliant_blue_G.
28435131	The sterile inflammatory response is an eminent contributor to CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen (CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP)-hepatotoxicity in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28435131	Recent advances unraveled an axial role of the GENE_10090)_NLRP3-inflammasome in CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-post DISEASE_D007249_injury_inflammation.
28435131	Nevertheless, the role of signaling events preceded the GENE_10090)_NLRP3-inflammasome activation, like the transcription factor NF-kB and the purinergic receptor P2X7, is still unclear and needs further elucidation.
28435131	Here, we investigated the pharmacological inhibition of these upstream signaling molecules by CHEMICAL_C050414_celastrol and CHEMICAL_C004692_brilliant_blue_G (CHEMICAL__BBG) (separately or simultaneously) in CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-hepatotoxicity in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28435131	The results indicated that both CHEMICAL_C050414_celastrol and CHEMICAL__BBG pretreatments, especially when combined together, curbed CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-induced DISEASE_D056486_hepatocellular_injury (ALT, GENE_10090)_AST and LDH) and DISEASE_D003643_death (DISEASE_D009336_necrosis and apoptosis).
28435131	The underlying mechanisms of protection of such combination against CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-challenge were attributed to their efficient cooperation in: i) preventing the consumption of hepatic antioxidants (CHEMICAL_D005978_reduced_glutathione and CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase); ii) limiting the overproduction of lipid CHEMICAL__peroxidation_aldehydes (CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde and CHEMICAL_C027576_4_hydroxynonenal) and total CHEMICAL_48107_nitrate/CHEMICAL_16301_nitrite products; iii) attenuating the inflammatory cells accumulation in the liver, as evidenced by reducing the number of SPECIES_10090_F4_80 positive cells/field in immunostaining and myeloperoxidase activity; iv) reversing the dysregulation in production of pro-inflammatory (TNF-a, GENE_10090)_IL_17A and GENE_10090)_IL_23) and anti-inflammatory (GENE_10090)_IL_10) cytokines; and v) enhancing the reparative capacity of injured hepatocytes, as demonstrated by increasing the percentage of GENE_10090)_PCNA positive hepatocytes per field of immunostaining.
28435131	In conclusion, this SPECIES_10090_murine study elicits a potential clinical applicability and therapeutic utility of CHEMICAL_C050414_celastrol and CHEMICAL__BBG combination in SPECIES_9606_human cases of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP-overdose hepatotoxicity.
28437613	Evaluating the Role of GENE_5244_Multidrug_Resistance_Protein_3 (GENE_5244_MDR3) Inhibition in Predicting DISEASE_D056486_Drug_Induced_Liver_Injury Using 125 Pharmaceuticals.
28437613	The role of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_salt export protein (GENE_8647_BSEP) inhibition in DISEASE_D056486_drug_induced_liver_injury (DISEASE_D056486_DILI) has been investigated widely, while inhibition of the canalicular GENE_5244_multidrug_resistant_protein_3 (GENE_5244_MDR3) has received less attention.
28437613	This transporter plays a pivotal role in secretion of phospholipids into bile and functions coordinately with GENE_8647_BSEP to mediate the formation of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid-containing biliary micelles.
28437613	Therefore, inhibition of GENE_5244_MDR3 in SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes was examined across 125 drugs (70 of Most-DISEASE_D056486_DILI-concern and 55 of No-DISEASE_D056486_DILI-concern).
28437613	Of these tested, 41% of Most-DISEASE_D056486_DILI-concern and 47% of No-DISEASE_D056486_DILI-concern drugs had GENE_5244_MDR3 IC50 values of <50  M. A better distinction across DISEASE_D056486_DILI classifications occurred when systemic exposure was considered where safety margins of 50-fold had low sensitivity (0.29), but high specificity (0.96).
28437613	Analysis of physical chemical property space showed that basic compounds were twice as likely to be GENE_5244_MDR3 inhibitors as acids, neutrals, and zwitterions and that inhibitors were more likely to have polar surface area (PSA) values of <100   2 and cPFLogD values between 1.5 and 5.
28437613	These descriptors, with different cutoffs, also highlighted a group of compounds that shared dual potency as GENE_5244_MDR3 and GENE_8647_BSEP inhibitors.
28437613	Nine drugs classified as Most-DISEASE_D056486_DILI-concern compounds (four withdrawn, four boxed warning, and one DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury warning in their approved label) had intrinsic potency features of <20  M in both assays, thereby reinforcing the notion that multiple inhibitory mechanisms governing bile formation (CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid and phospholipid efflux) may confer additional risk factors that play into more severe forms of DISEASE_D056486_DILI as shown by others for GENE_8647_BSEP inhibitors combined with GENE_8714_multidrug_resistance_associated_protein (GENE_1244_MRP2, GENE_8714_MRP3, GENE_10257_MRP4) inhibitory properties.
28437613	Avoiding physical property descriptors that highlight dual GENE_8647_BSEP and GENE_5244_MDR3 inhibition or testing drug candidates for inhibition of multiple efflux transporters (e.g., GENE_8647_BSEP, GENE_5244_MDR3, and MRPs) may be an effective strategy for prioritizing drug candidates with less likelihood of causing clinical DISEASE_D056486_DILI.
28438436	Effects of dextran sulfate CHEMICAL_D012964_sodium induced experimental DISEASE_D003092_colitis on cytochrome P450 activities in SPECIES_10116_rat liver, kidney and intestine.
28438436	Dextran sulfate CHEMICAL_D012964_sodium (DSS) induced experimental DISEASE_D003092_colitis presents a histologic resemblance to SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D003093_ulcerative_colitis (DISEASE_D003093_UC).
28438436	Altered cytochrome P450s (CYPs) have been reported in this model and SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D003093_UC.
28438436	In this study, six CYPs activities were quantitatively determined in microsomes of liver (RLMs), kidney (RRMs) and intestine (RIMs) from SPECIES_10116_rats with DISEASE_D003092_colitis at acute (5% DSS for 7 days, CHEMICAL__UCA) and remission (7-day DSS treatment followed by 7-day cessation, UCR) phases and compared with normal SPECIES_10116_rats.
28438436	Generally, CYPs activities varied with isoform, organ, and disease status.
28438436	Hepatic GENE_10116)_CYP1A2, 2B1, 2C6/11, 2E1 and 3A1/2 activities were reduced by acute DISEASE_D003092_colitis and completely or partially restored after DSS was halted.
28438436	Although DSS treatment decreased the Vmax of renal GENE_10116)_CYP2C6/11 and increased that of GENE_10116)_CYP2D2, their CLint, in  vitro were comparable among normal, acute and remission stages.
28438436	DSS treatment changed the kinetics of GENE_10116)_CYP3A1/2-mediated CHEMICAL_D009543_nifedipine metabolism in RRMs from biphasic to classical kinetics.
28438436	Notably, GENE_10116)_CYP2D2 activity was elevated in liver and kidney in acute DISEASE_D003093_UC, while enhanced in liver and decreased in kidney in remission.
28438436	In intestine, GENE_10116)_CYP3A1/2 activity was increased in CHEMICAL__UCA and further enhanced after DSS withdrawal.
28438436	These findings highlight the necessity of quantifying enzyme activity for precision drug therapy.
28442376	CHEMICAL_D019327_Copper_sulfate pretreatment prevents mitochondrial electron transport chain damage and apoptosis against CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28442376	Intrastriatal injection of CHEMICAL_D015655_1_methyl_4_phenylpyridinium (CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_) is considered a model to reproduce some biochemical alterations observed in DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) SPECIES_9606_patients.
28442376	Among those alterations, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, increased free radical production and reduced antioxidant responses have been reported.
28442376	CHEMICAL_D003300_Copper (CHEMICAL__Cu) plays an important role in the metabolism and antioxidative responses through its participation as a cofactor in the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme (COX), GENE_6647_Cu_Zn_superoxide_dismutase (CHEMICAL__Cu/CHEMICAL__Zn-SOD), and metallothioneins.
28442376	We tested the effect of CHEMICAL_D019327_copper_sulfate (CHEMICAL_31440_CuSO4) pretreatment on the mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC) in the striatum after CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28442376	The results showed that the CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ intrastriatal injection reduced mitochondrial complex I, II, IV and V activities; while 10   mol of CHEMICAL_31440_CuSO4 pretreatment counteracted this damage.
28442376	Activities of complexes I, II and IV, were coincident with CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP recovery.
28442376	Moreover, CHEMICAL__Cu/CHEMICAL__Zn-SOD activity was reduced as a consequence of CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ damage; however, CHEMICAL_D003300_copper pre-treatment kept the striatal GENE_6647_Cu_Zn_SOD activity unchanged in CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-damaged animals.
28442376	We observed that CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_ also reduced the metallothionein (MT) content and that CHEMICAL_31440_CuSO4 pretreatment maintained baseline values.
28442376	CHEMICAL_31440_CuSO4 pretreatment also reduced the striatal GENE_836_caspase_3 and GENE_842_caspase_9 activities that were increased three days after CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-induced damage.
28442376	The present study provided evidence that CHEMICAL_D003300_copper pretreatment reduced CHEMICAL_34761_MPP_-induced apoptotic damage, probably through direct action on DISEASE_C535468_copper_dependent_proteins or indirectly on proteins in the apoptotic pathway.
28442377	CHEMICAL_C403304_Zerumbone reduced the inflammatory response of DISEASE_D055371_acute_lung_injury in endotoxin-treated SPECIES_10090_mice via Akt-NFkB pathway.
28442377	CHEMICAL_C403304_Zerumbone, a cyclic eleven-membered CHEMICAL_35189_sesquiterpene, is the major component of the essential oil isolated from the wild ginger, Zingiber zerumbet.
28442377	There are several beneficial pharmacological activities of CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities.
28442377	DISEASE_D055371_Acute_lung_injury (DISEASE_D055371_ALI) is an DISEASE_D011014_acute_pulmonary_inflammatory_disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate.
28442377	In present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone on endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI.
28442377	SPECIES_10090_Mice were pretreated with CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone at various concentrations for 30  min followed by intratracheal administration of LPS for 6  h. Pretreatment with CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone not only reduced leukocytes infiltration into the alveolar space but also inhibited DISEASE_D004487_lung_edema in LPS-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI.
28442377	Decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as GENE_10090)_TNFa and GENE_10090)_IL_6 caused by LPS were reversed by CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone.
28442377	LPS-induced expressions of proinflammatory mediators, GENE_10090)_iNOS and GENE_10090)_COX_2, were inhibited by CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone.
28442377	In addition, NFkB activation and Akt phosphorylation were inhibited by CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone in LPS-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI.
28442377	All these results suggested that the protective mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C403304_zerumbone on endotoxin-induced DISEASE_D055371_ALI were via inhibition of Akt-NFkB activation.
28442378	Antihyperlipidemic and antiapoptotic potential of CHEMICAL_C013738_zingerone on CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol induced hepatotoxicity in experimental SPECIES_10116_rats.
28442378	The ultimate aim of this present study was to investigate the antihyperlipidemic and antiapoptotic potential of CHEMICAL_C013738_zingerone (ZO) on CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol induced hepatotoxicity in experimental SPECIES_10116_rats.
28442378	Male albino SPECIES_10116_wistar_rats were divided in four groups.
28442378	Groups 1 and 2 SPECIES_10116_rats received isocaloric CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and CHEMICAL_D004121_dimethyl_sulphoxide (2% CHEMICAL_D004121_DMSO), liver DISEASE_D064420_toxicity was induced in groups 3 and 4 by supplementing 30% CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol post orally for 60 days.
28442378	In addition to, groups 2 and 4 received CHEMICAL_C013738_zingerone (20  mg/kg body weight in 2% CHEMICAL_D004121_DMSO) daily during the final 30 days of the experimental period.
28442378	CHEMICAL_D000431_Ethanol alone administered SPECIES_10116_rats showed increased levels/activities of plasma total CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol (TC), CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides (TG), CHEMICAL_D005230_free_fatty_acids (CHEMICAL_42638_FFA), phospholipids (PL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), tissue TC, TG, CHEMICAL_42638_FFA, PL, CHEMICAL_C008047_HMG_CoA reductase, phase I xenobiotic enzymes, collagen and fat accumulation, DNA damage and increased GENE_10116)_Bax, GENE_10116)_caspase_3 and GENE_10116)_caspase_9 expressions and decrease in the levels/activities of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL), GENE_10116)_lipoprotein_lipase (LPL), GENE_10116)_lecithin_cholesterol_acyl_transferase (GENE_10116)_LCAT), phase II xenobiotic enzymes and a decreased GENE_10116)_Bcl_2 expression.
28442378	CHEMICAL_C013738_Zingerone supplementation was able to counter and reverse the CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol induced changes in all the above parameters in experimental SPECIES_10116_rats.
28442378	Together results portray CHEMICAL_C013738_zingerone exhibits antihyperlipidemic and antiapoptotic potential on CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol induced hepatotoxicity.
28442411	Evaluation of the bioactive extract of actinomyces isolated from the Egyptian environment against CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1-induce DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and oxidative stress in the liver of SPECIES_10116_rats.
28442411	This study aimed to determine the bioactive compounds of actinomyces (ACT) isolated from the Egyptian environment (D-EGY) and to evaluate their protective activity against CHEMICAL__AFB1 in female SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28442411	Six groups of animals were treated orally for 3 weeks included: C, the control group, T1, CHEMICAL__AFB1-treated group (80   g/kg b.w), T2 and T3, the groups received ACT extract at low (25  mg/kg b.w) or high (50  mg/kg b.w) doses, T4 and T5, the groups received CHEMICAL__AFB1 plus the low or high dose of ACT extract.
28442411	Blood, bone marrow and tissue samples were collected for different analyses and histological examination.
28442411	The results revealed the identification of 40 components, representing 99.98%.
28442411	Treatment with CHEMICAL__AFB1 disturbs liver function parameters, oxidative stress markers, antioxidant gene expressions, DNA fragmentation and induced severe histological changes.
28442411	ACT extract at the low or high doses did not induce significant changes in all the tested parameters or histological picture of the liver.
28442411	Moreover, ACT extract succeeded to induce a significant protection against the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL__AFB1.
28442411	It could be concluded that the bioactive compounds in ACT are promise candidate for the development of food additive or drugs for the protection and treatment of DISEASE_D008107_liver_disorders in the endemic area.
28444390	Characterization of Drug-Specific Signaling Between Primary SPECIES_9606_Human Hepatocytes and Immune Cells.
28444390	It is now apparent that antigen-specific T-cells are activated in certain SPECIES_9606_patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI).
28444390	Since cross-talk between hepatocytes and immune cells is likely to be critical in determining the outcome of drug exposure, the aim of this study was to profile the signals released by drug-treated hepatocytes and to characterize the impact of these molecules on dendritic cells.
28444390	SPECIES_9606_Human hepatocytes were exposed to 3 drugs (CHEMICAL_D005436_flucloxacillin, CHEMICAL_D000658_amoxicillin, and CHEMICAL_D007538_isoniazid) associated with DILI potentially mediated by the adaptive immune system as drug-specific T-cells have been isolated from DILI SPECIES_9606_patients, and the metabolite CHEMICAL_53017_nitroso_sulfamethoxazole (CHEMICAL_53017_SMX_NO).
28444390	Hepatocyte toxicity, cytokine release and activation of oxidative stress pathways were measured.
28444390	Supernatants were transferred to monocyte-derived dendritic cells and cell phenotype and function were assessed.
28444390	GENE_3146_High_mobility_group_box_1 protein (GENE_3146_HMGB1) and CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase release as well as CHEMICAL_D000255_adenosine_triphosphate depletion occurred in a drug-, time-, and concentration-dependent manner with CHEMICAL_53017_SMX_NO and CHEMICAL_D005436_flucloxacillin, whereas CHEMICAL_D007538_isoniazid and CHEMICAL_D000658_amoxicillin were nontoxic.
28444390	Furthermore, drug-induced activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 marker genes was observed when hepatocytes were exposed to test drugs.
28444390	The CHEMICAL_48343_disulfide isoform of GENE_3146_HMGB1 stimulated dendritic cell cytokine release and enhanced the priming of naive T-cells.
28444390	Incubation of dendritic cells with supernatant from drug-treated hepatocytes resulted in 2 distinct cytokine profiles.
28444390	CHEMICAL_53017_SMX_NO/CHEMICAL_D005436_flucloxacillin stimulated secretion of GENE_7124_TNF_a, GENE_3569_IL_6, GENE_3552_IL_1a, and GENE_3553_IL_1_b.
28444390	CHEMICAL_D007538_Isoniazid which did not induce significant hepatocyte toxicity, compared with CHEMICAL_9332_SMX-NO and CHEMICAL_D005436_flucloxacillin, stimulated the release of a panel of cytokines including the above and GENE_3458_IFN_y, IL-12, GENE_3605_IL_17A, GENE_3627_IP_10, and GENE_3586_IL_10.
28444390	Collectively, our study identifies drug-specific signaling pathways between hepatocytes and immune cells that could influence whether drug exposure will result in an immune response and tissue injury.
28444820	CHEMICAL_C054133_Casticin impairs cell migration and invasion of mouse DISEASE_D008545_melanoma B16F10 cells via PI3K/AKT and NF-kB signaling pathways.
28444820	CHEMICAL_C054133_Casticin, a CHEMICAL__polymethoxyflavone, is one of the major active components obtained from Fructus viticis, which have been shown to have anticancer activities including induce cell apoptosis in human DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells.
28444820	The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin inhibits cell migration and invasion of mouse DISEASE_D008545_melanoma B16F10 cells.
28444820	Cell viability was examined by CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay and the results indicated that CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin decreased the total percentages of viable cells in dose-dependent manners.
28444820	CHEMICAL_C054133_Casticin affected cell migration and invasion in B16F10 cells were examined by wound healing mobility assay and Boyden chamber migration and invasion assay and results indicated that CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin inhibited cell migration and invasion in dose-dependent manners.
28444820	Western blotting was used to examine the protein expression of B16F10 cells after exposed to CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin and the results showed that CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin decreased the expressions of MMP-9, MMP-2, MMP-1, FAK, 14-3-3, GRB2, Akt, NF-kB p65, SOS-1, p-EGFR, p-JNK 1/2, uPA, and Rho A in B16F10 cells.
28444820	Furthermore, cDNA microarray assay was used to show that CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin affected associated gene expression of cell migration and invasion and the results indicated that CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin affected some of the gene expression such as increased SCN1B (cell adhesion molecule 1) and TIMP2 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2) and decreased NDUFS4 (CHEMICAL_D009243_NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) CHEMICAL__Fe_S protein4), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), and DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3) which associated cell migration and invasion in B16F10 cells.
28444820	Based on those observations, we suggest that CHEMICAL_C054133_casticin could be used as a novel anticancer metastasis of DISEASE_D009369_melanoma_cancer in the future.
28444915	CHEMICAL_C031927_Hydroquinone induces TK6 cell growth arrest and apoptosis through GENE_142_PARP_1/GENE_7157_p53 regulatory pathway.
28444915	CHEMICAL_C031927_Hydroquinone (HQ), one of the most important metabolites derived from CHEMICAL_D001554_benzene, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
28444915	CHEMICAL_D011064_Poly_ADP_ribose_ polymerase-1 (GENE_142_PARP_1) participates in various biological processes, including DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.
28444915	To explore whether GENE_142_PARP_1 regulatory pathway mediated HQ-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we assessed the effect of GENE_142_PARP_1 suppression on induction of apoptosis analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer in GENE_142_PARP_1 deficientTK6 cells (TK6-shPARP-1).
28444915	We observed an increase in the fraction of cells in G1 phase by 7.6% and increased apoptosis by 4.5% in GENE_142_PARP_1-deficient TK6 cells (TK6-shPARP-1) compared to those negative control cells (TK6-shNC cells) in response to HQ treatment.
28444915	Furthermore, HQ might activate the extrinsic pathways of apoptosis via up-regulation of Fas expression, followed by GENE_836_caspase_3 activation, apoptotic body, and sub G1 accumulation.
28444915	Enhanced GENE_7157_p53 expression was observed in TK6-shPARP-1 cells than in TK6-shNC cells after HQ treatment.
28444915	In contrast, Fas expression was lower in TK6-shPARP-1 cells than in TK6-shNC cells.
28444915	Therefore, we conclude that HQ may activate apoptotic signals via Fas up-regulation and GENE_7157_p53-mediated apoptosis in TK6-shNC cells.
28444915	The reduction of GENE_142_PARP_1 expression further intensified up-regulation of GENE_7157_p53 in TK6-shPARP-1 cells, resulting in an increased G1 > S phase cell arrest and apoptosis in TK6-shPARP-1 cells compared to TK6-shNC cells.
28444938	Low concentration CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite activated JAK2/STAT3 signal and increased proliferative factor expressions in SV-HUC-1cells after short and long time treatment.
28444938	Epidemiological studies have indicated that ingestion of inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic resulted in increased risks of DISEASE_D001749_bladder_cancer and chronic hyperproliferation could play a direct role in the development of DISEASE_D009369_cancer.
28444938	This study examined the effects of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite on JAK2/STAT3 pathway and expressions of proliferation and anti-apoptosis factors.
28444938	The results showed that long term exposure to low doses CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite enhanced human uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1 cells) proliferation and BrdU positive rate was significant increased.
28444938	mRNA and protein expressions of proliferation factors, such as cyclin D1, COX-2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), increased in chronically exposed CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite SV-HUC-1 cells with exposure time.
28444938	Furthermore, JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway was activated following exposure to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite in SV-HUC-1 cells.
28444938	Knockdown of STAT3 reduced expressions of cyclin D1, COX-2, PCNA, and BCL2 induced by CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28444938	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic induced proliferation in human uroepithelial cells after short and long term exposure to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway might be pivotal in CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced proliferation by regulating cyclin D1, COX-2, PCNA, and BCL2.
28445388	Maternal Methyl SPECIES_9606_Donor Supplementation during Gestation Counteracts the Bisphenol A-Induced Impairment of Intestinal Morphology, Disaccharidase Activity, and Nutrient Transporters Gene Expression in SPECIES_9606_Newborn and Weaning SPECIES_9823_Pigs.
28445388	This study was conducted to explore whether exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) during pregnancy could change intestinal digestion and absorption function in offspring using SPECIES_9823_pigs as a model, and whether methyl SPECIES_9606_donor (MET) could counteract the BPA-induced impacts.
28445388	Fifty Landrace * Yorkshire sows were divided into four dietary groups throughout gestation: control diet (CON); control diet supplemented with BPA (50 mg/kg); control diet supplemented with MET (3 g/kg betaine, 400 mg/kg choline, 150  g/kg vitamin B12, and 15 mg/kg folic acid); and control diet with BPA and MET supplementation (BPA + MET).
28445388	Intestine samples were collected from SPECIES_9823_pigs' offspring at birth and weaning.
28445388	Maternal BPA exposure during pregnancy significantly reduced the ratio of jejunum villus height to crypt depth, decreased the jejunum sucrase activity, down-regulated the mRNA expression of jejunum peptide transporter 1 (<i>GENE_6564_Pept1</i>) and DNA methyl transferase 3a (<i>GENE_1788_DNMT3a</i>), and decreased the DNA methylation level of jejunum<i>GENE_6564_Pept1</i>in offspring (<i>p</i>< 0.05).
28445388	Maternal MET supplementation significantly raised the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in jejunum and ileum, improved the jejunum lactase activity, up-regulated the mRNA expression of jejunum<i>GENE_6564_Pept1</i>, lactase (<i>LCT</i>),<i>GENE_1786_DNMT1_/i>,<i>GENE_1788_DNMT3a</i>, and GENE_4524_methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase (<i>GENE_4524_MTHFR</i>), and increased the DNA methylation level of jejunum<i>GENE_6564_Pept1</i>in offspring (<i>p</i>< 0.05).
28445388	However, the ratio of jejunum villus height to crypt depth was higher in BPA + MET treatment compared with CON and BPA treatment (<i>p</i>< 0.05).
28445388	Meanwhile, there was no difference in the jejunum sucrase activity, the mRNA expression of jejunum<i>GENE_6564_Pept1</i>and<i>GENE_1788_DNMT3a</i>, and the DNA methylation level of jejunum<i>GENE_6564_Pept1</i>between CON and BPA + MET treatment.
28445388	These results indicated that maternal exposure to BPA during gestation might suppress offspring's intestinal digestion and absorption function, whereas supplementation of MET could counteract these damages, which might be associated with DNA methylation.
28446726	Low concentration of CHEMICAL__BPA induces SPECIES_10090_mice spermatocytes apoptosis via GENE_10090)_GPR30.
28446726	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) acts as CHEMICAL__xenoestrogen and has a great impact on disorders of SPECIES_9606_human reproductive system.
28446726	However, the mechanism through which CHEMICAL__BPA can affect SPECIES_9606_human testicular function remains to be identified.
28446726	GENE_10090)_GPR30 is a novel membrane CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor with high-affinity and low-capacity binding to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens.
28446726	We demonstrated that CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor a (GENE_10090)_ERa), CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor b (GENE_10090)_ERb) as well as GENE_10090)_GPR30 are expressed in SPECIES_10090_mouse spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells using Real-time PCR.
28446726	We treated the cells with different doses of CHEMICAL__BPA and found that even low doses of CHEMICAL__BPA can inhibit GC-2 cell growth using CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay.
28446726	To make sure which receptor is responsible for the biological function of CHEMICAL__BPA, we used ER down-regulator ICI and indicated that CHEMICAL__BPA could bind to GENE_10090)_GPR30.
28446726	We also observed that CHEMICAL__BPA was able to induce GENE_26417;26413_Erk1_2 phosphorylation in GC-2 cells and proved that this process was mediated by GENE_10090)_GPR30-related GENE_10090)_EGFR-MAPK pathway using western blot.
28446726	By Real-time PCR, we found that the expression of GENE_10090)_c_Fos was up-regulated and GENE_10090)_Cyclin_D1 gene was down-regulated, in the presence of CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__ICI.
28446726	The results of CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay, comet assay and flow cytometry indicated that the activation of GENE_10090)_GPR30 induced by CHEMICAL__BPA inhibited the cell growth and induced cell apoptosis and ICI, GENE_10090)_GPR30 siRNA, GENE_10090)_EGFR inhibitor (AG), and MAPK (PD) inhibitor could partially reverse this effect.
28446726	Immunohistochemistry on the testis of CHEMICAL__BPA -damaged SPECIES_10090_mice showed that CHEMICAL__BPA induced spermatocyte apoptosis without affecting the seminiferous tubules and spermatocyte.
28446726	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__BPA triggered spermatocyte apoptosis via GENE_10090)_GPR30.
28446605	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout screens and target identification via DISEASE_D042822_whole_genome_sequencing uncover host genes required for DISEASE_D010850_picornavirus_infection.
28446605	Several groups have used genome-wide libraries of lentiviruses encoding small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for genetic screens.
28446605	In most cases, sgRNA expression cassettes are integrated into cells by using lentiviruses, and target genes are statistically estimated by the readout of sgRNA sequences after targeted sequencing.
28446605	We present a new virus-free method for SPECIES_9606_human gene knockout screens using a genome-wide library of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs based on plasmids and target gene identification via DISEASE_D042822_whole_genome_sequencing (DISEASE_D042822_WGS) confirmation of authentic mutations rather than statistical estimation through targeted amplicon sequencing.
28446605	We used 30,840 pairs of individually synthesized oligonucleotides to construct the genome-scale sgRNA library, collectively targeting 10,280 SPECIES_9606_human genes (i.e.
28446605	three sgRNAs per gene).
28446605	These plasmid libraries were co-transfected with a Cas9-expression plasmid into SPECIES_9606_human cells, which were then treated with cytotoxic drugs or viruses.
28446605	Only cells lacking key factors essential for cytotoxic drug metabolism or DISEASE_D014777_viral_infection were able to survive.
28446605	Genomic DNA isolated from cells that survived these challenges was subjected to DISEASE_D042822_WGS to directly identify CRISPR/Cas9-mediated causal mutations essential for cell survival.
28446605	With this approach, we were able to identify known and novel genes essential for DISEASE_D014777_viral_infection in SPECIES_9606_human cells.
28446605	We propose that genome-wide sgRNA screens based on plasmids coupled with DISEASE_D042822_WGS are powerful tools for forward genetics studies and drug target discovery.
28450151	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin, a natural product supplement, impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and locomotor behavior in larval SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio).
28450151	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin is a natural product that is sold as a supplement in health food stores.
28450151	While there are reported benefits for this CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid as a dietary supplement due to antioxidant properties, the full scope of its biological interactions has not been fully addressed.
28450151	To learn more about the mechanisms of action related to CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin, we exposed SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) embryos to 1 and 10 g/L CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin for 96h starting at 3h post fertilization.
28450151	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin up to 10 g/L did not induce significant mortality in developing fish, but did increase prevalence of an upward-curved dorsal plane in hatched larvae.
28450151	To determine whether this DISEASE_D002658_developmental_defect was potentially related to mitochondrial bioenergetics during development, we measured CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen consumption rate in whole embryos following a 24-hour exposure to CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin.
28450151	Basal mitochondrial and CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-linked respiration were decreased at 1 and 10 g/L CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin, and maximal respiration was decreased at 10 g/L CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin, suggesting that CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics.
28450151	This is proposed to be related to the deformities observed during development.
28450151	Due to the fact that CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production was affected by CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin, DISEASE_D001523_larval_behaviors related to locomotion were investigated, as well as transcriptional responses of six myogenesis transcripts.
28450151	CHEMICAL_D011794_Quercetin at 10 g/L significantly reduced the swimming velocity of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish larvae.
28450151	The expression levels of both GENE_7955)_myostatin_A (CHEMICAL__mstna) and myogenic differentiation (GENE_7955)_myoD) were also altered by CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin.
28450151	CHEMICAL__Mstna, an inhibitory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 1 g/L CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin exposure, while GENE_7955)_myoD, a stimulatory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 10 g/L CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin exposure.
28450151	There were no changes in transcripts related to apoptosis (GENE_7955)_bcl2, GENE_7955)_bax, GENE_7955)_casp3, GENE_7955)_casp7), but we did observe a decrease in mRNA levels for GENE_7955)_catalase (cat) in fish exposed to each dose, supporting an oxidative stress response.
28450151	Our data support the hypothesis that CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin may affect locomotion and induce deformities in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish larvae by diminishing CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production and by altering the expression of transcripts related to muscle formation and activity.
28451739	Understanding renal nuclear protein accumulation: an in vitro approach to explain an in vivo phenomenon.
28451739	Proper subcellular trafficking is essential to prevent protein mislocalization and aggregation.
28451739	Transport of the peroxisomal enzyme CHEMICAL_16733_D_amino_acid oxidase (DAAO) appears dysregulated by specific pharmaceuticals, e.g., the anti-overactive bladder drug CHEMICAL_C015586_propiverine or a CHEMICAL_D009638_norepinephrine/CHEMICAL_D012701_serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NSRI), resulting in massive cytosolic and nuclear accumulations in rat kidney.
28451739	To assess the underlying molecular mechanism of the latter, we aimed to characterize the nature of peroxisomal and cyto-nuclear shuttling of human and rat DAAO overexpressed in three cell lines using confocal microscopy.
28451739	Indeed, interference with peroxisomal transport via deletion of the PTS1 signal or PEX5 knockdown resulted in induced nuclear DAAO localization.
28451739	Having demonstrated the absence of active nuclear import and employing variably sized mCherry- and/or EYFP-fusion proteins of DAAO and catalase, we showed that peroxisomal proteins <= 134  kDa can passively diffuse into mammalian cell nuclei-thereby contradicting the often-cited 40  kDa diffusion limit.
28451739	Moreover, their inherent nuclear presence and nuclear accumulation subsequent to proteasome inhibition or abrogated peroxisomal transport suggests that nuclear localization is a characteristic in the lifecycle of peroxisomal proteins.
28451739	Based on this molecular trafficking analysis, we suggest that pharmaceuticals like CHEMICAL_C015586_propiverine or an NSRI may interfere with peroxisomal protein targeting and import, consequently resulting in massive nuclear protein accumulation in vivo.
28453771	From the Cover: Interplay Between IFN-y and GENE_10090)_IL_6 Impacts the Inflammatory Response and Expression of Interferon-Regulated Genes in Environmental-Induced Autoimmunity.
28453771	IFN-y has been found to be robustly important to disease pathogenesis in both idiopathic and induced models of SPECIES_10090_murine lupus.
28453771	In SPECIES_10090_transgenic_mice, over production of IFN-y in the skin results in an inflammatory response and autoimmunity.
28453771	This suggests that localized exposure to environmental factors that induce autoimmunity may be associated with expression of an IFN-y-dependent inflammatory response.
28453771	Using SPECIES_10090_murine CHEMICAL_D008628_mercury-induced autoimmunity (mHgIA), the severity of inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine expression, including the cellular source of IFN-y, were assessed at the site of subcutaneous exposure and in secondary lymphoid organs.
28453771	Exposure induced a localized chronic inflammation comprising both innate and adaptive immune cells but only CD8+ T and NK cells were reduced in the absence of IFN-y.
28453771	IFN-y+ cells began to appear as early as day 1 and comprised both resident (y   T) and infiltrating cells (CD8+ T, NKT, GENE_10090)_CD11c+).
28453771	The requirements for inflammation were examined in SPECIES_10090_mice deficient in genes required (Ifng, GENE_10090)_Il6) or not required (GENE_10090)_Casp1) for mHgIA.
28453771	None of these genes were essential for induction of inflammation, however IFN-y and GENE_10090)_IL_6 were required for exacerbation of other proinflammatory cytokines.
28453771	Additionally, lack of IFN-y or GENE_10090)_IL_6 impacted expression of genes regulated by either IFN-y or type I IFN.
28453771	Significantly, both IFN-y and GENE_10090)_IL_6 were required for increased expression of GENE_10090)_IRF_1 which regulates IFN stimulated genes and is required for mHgIA.
28453771	Thus GENE_10090)_IRF_1 may be at the nexus of the interplay between IFN-y and GENE_10090)_IL_6 in exacerbating a xenobiotic-induced inflammatory response, regulation of interferon responsive genes and autoimmunity.
28453788	From the Cover: Usage of CHEMICAL_D003907_Dexamethasone Increases the Risk of Cranial Neural Crest Dysplasia in the SPECIES_9031_Chick Embryo.
28453788	CHEMICAL_D003907_Dexamethasone (CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex) is commonly used in the treatment of a variety of benign and malignant conditions.
28453788	Unfortunately, although it has a variety of teratogenic effects, it remains used in clinical practice for pregnant SPECIES_9606_women mainly due to limited alternatives.
28453788	However, there is limited knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to the observed teratogenic effects.
28453788	In this study, the effects of CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex during embryogenesis on neural crest development were evaluated in the early SPECIES_9031_chick embryos.
28453788	First, we demonstrated that 100   l 10-6 M CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex treatment leads to craniofacial developmental defects, and also retards embryo growth and plausibly can cause embryo demise.
28453788	Second, we demonstrated that CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex represses the production of GENE_10090)_HNK_1, GENE_10090)_PAX7, and GENE_10090)_AP_2a labeled cranial neural crest cells, the progenitor cells of the craniofacial skeleton.
28453788	Third, double immunofluorescent staining of pHIS3/GENE_9031)_PAX7 and GENE_10090)_AP_2a/c-GENE_9031)_Caspase3 revealed that CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex promotes cell apoptosis but does not change cell proliferation rates.
28453788	Last, fibroblast growth factor signaling molecules were inhibited by CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex treatment.
28453788	CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex also inhibited neural crest cells production by repressing GENE_9031)_Msx1 expression in the developing neural tube and by altering expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related adhesion molecules and cell migration genes.
28453788	Overall, we obtained experimental evidence that CHEMICAL_D003907_Dex treatment during embryogenesis disrupts cranial neural crest development which in turn causes defective cranial bone development.
28454766	Mixture effects of CHEMICAL_68452_azole fungicides on the adrenal gland in a broad dose range.
28454766	Consumers are exposed to low concentrations of a variety of pesticide residues in or on food.
28454766	Some of them might interfere with the endocrine system.
28454766	While each individual active substance has been extensively tested for DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and safety, potential combination effects possibly resulting from combined exposure to different pesticides have seldomly been tested so far, especially in vivo.
28454766	Since the adrenal gland is a key endocrine organ, we investigated if and how substances of a group of CHEMICAL_24127_fungicides presumed to interfere with the biosynthesis of CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormones affect this organ when applied individually and in combination in a broad dose range.
28454766	A 28-day feeding study was conducted in SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats by using three CHEMICAL_38597__tri_azole fungicides considered to potentially affect the endocrine system (CHEMICAL_C093628_cyproconazole, CHEMICAL_C109476_epoxiconazole and CHEMICAL_C045362_prochloraz) individually at five dose levels, ranging from 0.9ppm to 2400ppm, and in combination at three dose levels.
28454766	The parameters analysed included classical toxicology (pathology, histopathology, clinical chemistry) and molecular toxicology endpoints (gene expression arrays and quantitative real time PCR e.g.
28454766	of Star, GENE_3283_HSD3b, GENE_1583_Cyp11a1, GENE_1584_Cyp11b1, GENE_1585_Cyp11b2, GENE_1589_Cyp_21, GENE_348_ApoE), as well as hormone analysis.
28454766	A dose-dependent decrease in the adrenal gland weight of SPECIES_10116_rats treated with CHEMICAL_C109476_epoxiconazole alone, which was accompanied by an DISEASE_D001284_atrophy of the adrenal gland as well as by an increase in the serum CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol level and which only became statistically significant at the top dose levels, was observed.
28454766	These effects were attenuated in the combination experiments, although the same CHEMICAL_C109476_epoxiconazole concentration was used.
28454924	Dual effect of silymarin on experimental DISEASE_D005235_non_alcoholic_steatohepatitis induced by CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan.
28454924	CHEMICAL_C051890_Irinotecan-based regimens are commonly used for treatment of DISEASE_D015179_colorectal_cancer, which is limited by DISEASE_D052016_mucositis and DISEASE_D005235_non_alcoholic_steatohepatitis (DISEASE_D005235_NASH).
28454924	Silymarin (SIL) prevents DISEASE_D008107_fatty_liver_disease in the clinical setting and in models of DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage induced chemically.
28454924	This study investigated the possible effect of SIL on CHEMICAL_C051890_irinotecan (CHEMICAL__IRI)-induced DISEASE_D005235_NASH.
28454924	Swiss female SPECIES_10090_mice were injected with saline (SAL 5ml/kg i.p.
28454924	), CHEMICAL__IRI (50mg/kg i.p.
28454924	), SIL (150mg/kg p.o.)
28454924	or CHEMICAL__IRI (50mg/kg i.p.
28454924	)+(SIL 1.5, 15 or 150mg/kg p.o.)
28454924	thrice/week/7weeks.
28454924	On the seventh week, blood samples were collected for transaminases assay and livers were collected for histopathology, measurement of the total lipids, CHEMICAL__malondyadehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA), non-protein CHEMICAL__sulfhydryl groups (NPSH), cytokines (GENE_10090)_IL_1b, IL 6 and IL-10), CHEMICAL_44454_3_nitrotyrosine (CHEMICAL__N_Tyr) and toll-like receptor 4 (GENE_10090)_TLR4) immunoexpression, quantification of NF-kB, a-smooth muscle actin (GENE_10090)_a_SMA), and SPECIES_562_Escherichia_coli 16S rRNA gene (DISEASE_C535863_RRS) expression.
28454924	CHEMICAL__IRI increased liver transaminases, neutrophil infiltration, lipid accumulation, CHEMICAL_566274_MDA, GENE_10090)_IL_1b and GENE_10090)_IL_6 levels, CHEMICAL__N_Tyr and GENE_10090)_TLR4 immunostaining, NF-kB, GENE_10090)_a_SMA expression and DISEASE_C535863_RRS versus the SAL group (p<0.05).
28454924	Additionally, SIL (1.5mg/kg) improved these parameters (p<0.05), except neutrophil infiltration and RSS versus the CHEMICAL__IRI group.
28454924	Furthermore, the SIL (15mg/kg) only improved the inflammatory parameters, the expression of GENE_10090)_a_SMA and DISEASE_C535863_RRS versus the CHEMICAL__IRI group (p<0.05).
28454924	The higher dose of SIL (150mg/kg) was even more deleterious than the intermediate dose.
28454924	Therefore, silymarin showed a dual effect on DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage induced by CHEMICAL__IRI.
28454924	Hepatoprotection seems to involve the inhibition of oxidative stress and protein nitrosylation, preventing activation of hepatic DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis mechanisms.
28456543	DISEASE_D064420_Subchronic_toxicity of low dose CHEMICAL_D001074_propoxur, CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin, and their combination on the redox status of SPECIES_10116_rat liver.
28456543	CHEMICAL_D002219_Carbamates and CHEMICAL_D011722_pyrethroids are widely used pesticides.
28456543	However, their joint DISEASE_D064420_toxicity at low doses with long-term exposure remains unknown.
28456543	Therefore, we investigated the subchronic joint hepatotoxicity of the two representative pesticides within these two classes, i.e., propoxur (PR) and CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin (PE) in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28456543	The male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were orally treated with three different doses of PR, PE and their mixtures for 90 consecutive days.
28456543	Liver weight, serum clinical chemistry parameters and histopathological changes were measured to access the hepatotoxicity.
28456543	In addition, oxidative stress markers in liver were measured using biochemical assays.
28456543	The results showed that PR reduced liver weight and lead to prominent liver histological changes.
28456543	Moreover, PR dose-dependently induced lipid peroxidation and reduced CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase activity.
28456543	In contrast, PE induced a relatively mild hepatotoxicity.
28456543	Intriguingly, the mixture of PR and PE did not reduce liver weight or increase serum CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate transaminase activity.
28456543	In addition, the mixture did not reduce the antioxidant enzyme activity as PR did.
28456543	Thus, these results showed that PR induced prominent hepatotoxicity with subchronic exposure, and there is a potential antagonistic interaction between PR and PE on the oxidative damage in liver of SPECIES_10116_rats.
28456544	Gastroprotective effect of CHEMICAL_D005680_gamma_aminobutyric_acid against CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol-induced DISEASE_D013272_gastric_mucosal_injury.
28456544	The present study aimed to investigate the gastroprotective effect of CHEMICAL_D005680_gamma_aminobutyric_acid (CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA) on CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol-induced DISEASE_D013272_gastric_mucosal_injury and DISEASE_D013274_gastric epithelial cells injury.
28456544	SPECIES_10116_Rats were divided into the control group, vehicle group and CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA-treated groups (10, 20 and 40  mg/kg/day).
28456544	After CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA ingestion for 14 days, SPECIES_10116_rats except the control group were given 1  mL pure CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol by oral gavage in order to induce DISEASE_D009059_acute_gastric_mucosal_lesion.
28456544	The SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D013274_gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 was incubated with CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA (100, 200 and 400  M) for 24  h, followed by treatment with 8% CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol for 3  h to induce cell injury.
28456544	The results showed that CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA pretreatment significantly reduced DISEASE_D013274_gastric ulcer index in a dose-dependent manner.
28456544	CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA pretreatment could not only remarkably restrain oxidative stress by increasing activities of CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase and GENE_10116)_catalase as well as decreasing content of CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde both in DISEASE_D013274_gastric tissue and cells, but also significantly reduced pro-inflammatory factors (GENE_10116)_interleukin_6 and DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor a) levels in DISEASE_D013274_gastric tissue.
28456544	In addition, significant augments of CHEMICAL_D015232_prostaglandin_E2 and CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide levels were observed in the DISEASE_D013274_gastric tissues of 40  mg/kg/d CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA treated group.
28456544	In conclusion, the results in this study suggested that CHEMICAL_D005680_GABA could alleviate CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol-induced DISEASE_D013272_gastric_mucosal_injury and DISEASE_D013274_gastric epithelial cells injury through the improvement of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant status, as well as the increase of CHEMICAL_D015232_PGE2 and NO levels.
28454374	CHEMICAL_C006632_Arsenic_trioxide inhibits DISEASE_D009369_tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells and enhances T-cell activity.
28454374	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), one of the major orchestrators of the immunosuppressive network, are associated with immune suppression and considered a prime target for DISEASE_D009369_cancer immunotherapy.
28454374	At present, various strategies have been explored to deplete and/or inactivate MDSCs in vivo.
28454374	In this study, we investigated the effect of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO) on MDSCs derived from DISEASE_D009369_tumor-bearing SPECIES_10090_mice.
28454374	This study examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO administration on MDSCs from C57/j SPECIES_10090_mice bearing either the B16 or H22 DISEASE_D009369_tumor.
28454374	The MDSCs were then characterized for phenotype, gene expression and function.
28454374	Administration with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO in vitro significantly induced MDSC differentiation, inhibited their proliferation and triggered apoptosis.
28454374	Treatment with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO in these SPECIES_10090_murine DISEASE_D009369_tumor models significantly inhibited DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth and DISEASE_D013163_splenomegaly, decreased the percentages of MDSCs in the spleen, promoted their differentiation, reduced DISEASE_D009369_tumor necrosis factor-a and GENE_10090)_interleukin_10 levels and weakened the immune inhibition activity of MDSCs on T cells.
28454374	In addition, we observed the underlying mechanism involved in the regulation of MDSCs by CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO, which included a panel of cytokines and signaling pathways.
28454374	The findings showed the immunoregulatory effects of CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO by inducing apoptosis, promoting differentiation and inhibiting the function of MDSCs, suggesting that CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO has potential clinical benefit as it selectively attenuates MDSC-induced immunosuppression.
28458013	Aberrant methylation of GENE_864_RUNX3 is present in CHEMICAL_D016604_Aflatoxin_B1-induced transformation of the PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|L|02|R_L02R cell line.
28458013	Chronic exposure to CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1 (CHEMICAL__AFB1) is linked to the development of DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC).
28458013	To identify differentially methylated genes involved in CHEMICAL__AFB1-induced cell transformation, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns in immortal SPECIES_9606_human hepatocyte L02 cells expressing an oncogenic H-Ras allele (PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|L|02|R_L02R cells) and CHEMICAL__AFB1-transformed PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|L|02|R_L02R (L02RT-CHEMICAL__AFB1) cells by performing genome-wide methylation profiling.
28458013	We treated PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|L|02|R_L02R cells with 0.3 M CHEMICAL__AFB1 weekly and observed a transformed phenotype at the 17th week post-treatment.
28458013	The transformed cells (L02RT-CHEMICAL__AFB1) could grow in an anchorage independent DISEASE_D009369_fashion_and_form_tumors in DISEASE_D007153_immunodeficient SPECIES_10090_mice.
28458013	qRT-PCR was performed to examine whether gene methylation led to a reduction in gene expression of methylated candidate genes.
28458013	As a result, the expression of the following seven genes including GENE_3726_JUNB, GENE_864_RUNX3, GENE_89796_NAV1, GENE_7852_CXCR4, GENE_5918_RARRES1, GENE_26173_INTS1, and GENE_27343_POLL was down-regulated in transformed L02RT-CHEMICAL__AFB1 cells.
28458013	The reduction of gene expression of these genes could be reversed by treatment of CHEMICAL_C014347_5_azadeoxycytidine.
28458013	The methylated CHEMICAL__CpG sites of GENE_864_RUNX3 genes were verified using CHEMICAL_C042345_bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) assay.
28458013	Furthermore, a dynamic change in GENE_864_RUNX3 methylation was observed over the course of CHEMICAL__AFB1-induced cell transformation, which was corresponded to the alteration of gene expression and the extent of DNA damage.
28458013	In vitro study showed that methylation of GENE_864_RUNX3 tended to abate in PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|L|02|R_L02R cells treated with CHEMICAL__AFB1 for a short-term period of time.
28458013	Notably, hypermethylation of GENE_864_RUNX3 appeared in 70% (14/20) of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinomas.
28458013	Moreover, LINE-1 hypomethylation and dynamic changes of DNMTs, TETs and GENE_4204_MeCP2 expression were also observed during CHEMICAL__AFB1-induced transformation.
28458013	Taken together, these observations suggest that aberrant methylation of GENE_864_RUNX3 and LINE-1 might be involved in CHEMICAL__AFB1-induced DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28465020	CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside attenuates CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_RSC96 Schwann cells through GENE_10116)_PI3K/GENE_10116)_Akt pathway.
28465020	DISEASE_D020258_Neurotoxicity is a key dose-limiting factor for CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin therapy.
28465020	This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside on CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_RSC96 Schwann cells and the underlying mechanisms.
28465020	After CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside (12.5, 25, 50   g/mL) treatment for 2  h, the cells were cultured with 250   g/mL CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin for 24  h. In order to investigate the role of CHEMICAL_D010716_phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (GENE_10116)_PI3K/GENE_10116)_Akt) pathway, the cells were pre-treated with CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002 (12.5   mol/L, a specific inhibitor of GENE_10116)_PI3K phosphorylation) for 1  h before CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside (50   g/mL) treatment, then were co-cultured with CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin (250   g/mL) for 24  h. The results showed that CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin treatment could induce apoptotic cell death which was associated with oxidative stress injury.
28465020	CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside could reduce CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity, decrease the effect of CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin on the reduced expression levels of p-GENE_10116)_Akt and GENE_10116)_Bcl_2, and increased the expresion of GENE_10116)_Bax, release of Cyt c, and activation of GENE_10116)_caspase_3.
28465020	However, the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside against CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced apoptosis was partly abolished by CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002.
28465020	These findings suggest that CHEMICAL_C009172_Salidroside could attenuate CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_RSC96 Schwann cells via the GENE_10116)_PI3K/GENE_10116)_Akt pathway.
28467894	Potential mechanisms of development-dependent adverse effects of the herbicide CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat in 3D SPECIES_10116_rat brain cell cultures.
28467894	Exposure to environmental toxicants during vulnerable windows of brain development is suspected to raise the prevalence for DISEASE_D009461_neurological_dysfunctions at later stages in life.
28467894	Differentiation processes and changes in morphology, as well as a lack of physiological barriers, might be reasons that render a developing brain more susceptible to neurotoxicants than an adult.
28467894	However, also the intrinsic capacity of cells to combat toxicant induced cellular stress might differ between the immature- and mature brain.
28467894	In order to study whether this intrinsic protection capacity differs between immature and maturated brain cells we chose to study the maturation-dependent adverse effects of the known neurotoxicant CHEMICAL_28786_Paraquat_Dichloride (PQ) in 3D SPECIES_10116_rat brain cell cultures.
28467894	This in vitro system consists of the major brain cell types - neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia - and over the time in vitro cultured cells undergo differentiation and maturation into a tissue-like organization.
28467894	PQ was applied repeatedly over ten days in the sub-micromolar range, and effects were evaluated on neurons and glial cells.
28467894	We observed that despite a higher PQ-uptake in mature cultures, PQ-induced adverse effects on glutamatergic-, GABAergic- and dopaminergic neurons, as assessed by gene expression and enzymatic activity, were more pronounced in immature cultures.
28467894	This was associated with a stronger astrogliosis in immature- as compared to mature cultures, as well as perturbations of the CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-mediated defense against oxidative stress.
28467894	Furthermore we observed evidence of microglial activation only in mature cultures, whereas immature cultures appeared to down-regulate markers for neuroprotective M2-microglial phenotype upon PQ-exposure.
28467894	Taken together our results indicate that immature brain cell cultures have less intrinsic capacity to cope with cellular stress elicited by PQ as compared to mature cells.
28467894	This may render immature brain cells more susceptible to the adverse effects of PQ.
28470405	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic-mediated DISEASE_D017495_hyperpigmentation in skin via NF-kappa B/endothelin-1 signaling in an originally developed hairless mouse model.
28470405	Chronic exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic is associated with various diseases in humans.
28470405	DISEASE_D012871_Skin_hyperpigmentation is the most sensitive objective symptom for patients with arsenicosis.
28470405	However, there is very limited information about the mechanism of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated DISEASE_D012871_skin_hyperpigmentation in vivo.
28470405	In this study, hairless homozygous mice (CHEMICAL__Hr/CHEMICAL__Hr-mice) that drank water containing 3 and 30    M CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic for 2  months developed DISEASE_D012871_skin_hyperpigmentation with increased levels of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and number of melanocytes in the skin.
28470405	Since it is possible for humans to be exposed to 3    M of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic in well drinking water, our results suggest that the CHEMICAL__Hr/CHEMICAL__Hr-mice could be a novel model sensitively reflecting CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated DISEASE_D012871_skin_hyperpigmentation.
28470405	We then analyzed the mechanism of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated DISEASE_D012871_skin_hyperpigmentation.
28470405	The epidermis of CHEMICAL__Hr/CHEMICAL__Hr-mice and human HaCaT skin keratinocytes exposed to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic for 2 and 4  months, respectively, showed 5.4-21.5-fold increased levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression via NF-kappa B activation.
28470405	Coexposure of primary normal human epithelial melanocytes to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and ET-1 activated their proliferation and melanin synthesis with increased levels of MITF-M and ET-1 receptor expression.
28470405	Our results suggest that interaction between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the skin through ET-1 and its receptor contributes to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated skin pigmentation, a hallmark of arsenicosis.
28472268	CHEMICAL_D009532_Nickel induces transcriptional down-regulation of DNA repair pathways in tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic lung cells.
28472268	The heavy metal CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel is a known carcinogen, and occupational exposure to CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel compounds has been implicated in SPECIES_9606_human lung and nasal cancers.
28472268	Unlike many other environmental carcinogens, however, CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel does not directly induce DNA mutagenesis, and the mechanism of CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel-related carcinogenesis remains incompletely understood.
28472268	Cellular CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel exposure leads to signaling pathway activation, transcriptional changes and epigenetic remodeling, processes also impacted by hypoxia, which itself promotes tumor growth without causing direct DNA damage.
28472268	One of the mechanisms by which hypoxia contributes to tumor growth is the generation of genomic instability via down-regulation of high-fidelity DNA repair pathways.
28472268	Here, we find that CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel exposure similarly leads to down-regulation of DNA repair proteins involved in homology-dependent DNA double-strand break repair (HDR) and mismatch repair (MMR) in tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic SPECIES_9606_human lung cells.
28472268	Functionally, CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel induces a defect in HDR capacity, as determined by plasmid-based host cell reactivation assays, persistence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.
28472268	Mechanistically, we find that CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel, in contrast to the metalloid CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic, acutely induces transcriptional repression of HDR and MMR genes as part of a global transcriptional pattern similar to that seen with hypoxia.
28472268	Finally, we find that exposure to low-dose CHEMICAL_D009532_nickel reduces the activity of the GENE_4292_MLH1 promoter, but only CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic leads to long-term GENE_4292_MLH1 promoter silencing.
28472268	Together, our data elucidate novel mechanisms of heavy metal carcinogenesis and contribute to our understanding of the influence of the microenvironment on the regulation of DNA repair pathways.
28472532	High-Throughput Screening Data Interpretation in the Context of In Vivo Transcriptomic Responses to Oral CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ Exposure.
28472532	The DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_C074702_hexavalent_chromium [CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_] in drinking water has been studied extensively, and available in vivo and in vitro studies provide a robust dataset for application of advanced toxicological tools to inform the mode of action (MOA).
28472532	This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ MOA by evaluating DISEASE_C538394_high_throughput_screening (DISEASE_C538394_HTS) data and other in vitro data relevant to CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_, and comparing these findings to robust in vivo data, including transcriptomic profiles in target tissues.
28472532	Evaluation of Tox21 DISEASE_C538394_HTS data for CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ identified 11 active assay endpoints relevant to the Ten Key Characteristics of Carcinogens (TKCCs) that have been proposed by other investigators.
28472532	Four of these endpoints were related to GENE_7157_TP53 (GENE_7157_tumor_protein_53) activation mapping to genotoxicity (GENE_57468_KCC_2), and four were related to cell death/proliferation (KCC#10).
28472532	DISEASE_C538394_HTS results were consistent with other in vitro data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.
28472532	In vitro responses were compared to in vivo transcriptomic responses in the most sensitive target tissue, the duodenum, of SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to   <=    180   ppm CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ for 7 and 90 days.
28472532	Pathways that were altered both in vitro and in vivo included those relevant to cell death/proliferation.
28472532	In contrast, pathways relevant to GENE_7157_p53/DNA damage were identified in vitro but not in vivo.
28472532	Benchmark dose modeling and phenotypic anchoring of in vivo transcriptomic responses strengthened the finding that CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ causes cell stress/injury followed by proliferation in the SPECIES_10090_mouse duodenum at high doses.
28472532	These findings contribute to the body of evidence supporting a non-mutagenic MOA for CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_-induced DISEASE_D009369_intestinal_cancer.
28472674	CHEMICAL_D012439_Saccharin induced DISEASE_D008107_liver_inflammation in SPECIES_10090_mice by altering the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions.
28472674	Maintaining the balance of the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions is vital for SPECIES_9606_human health, however, this balance can be disrupted by various external factors including food additives.
28472674	A range of food and beverages are sweetened by CHEMICAL_D012439_saccharin, which is generally considered to be safe despite controversial debates.
28472674	However, recent studies indicated that CHEMICAL_D012439_saccharin perturbed the gut microbiota.
28472674	DISEASE_D007249_Inflammation is frequently associated with disruptions of the gut microbiota.
28472674	The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between host DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and perturbed gut microbiome by CHEMICAL_D012439_saccharin.
28472674	SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6J SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice were treated with CHEMICAL_D012439_saccharin in drinking water for six months.
28472674	Q-PCR was used to detect inflammatory markers in SPECIES_10090_mouse liver, while 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics were used to reveal changes of the gut microbiota and its metabolomic profiles.
28472674	Elevated expression of pro-inflammatory GENE_10090)_iNOS and GENE_10090)_TNF_a in liver indicated that CHEMICAL_D012439_saccharin induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28472674	The altered gut SPECIES_2_bacterial genera, enriched orthologs of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as DISEASE_C536528_LPS and SPECIES_2_bacterial toxins, in concert with increased pro-inflammatory metabolites suggested that the CHEMICAL_D012439_saccharin-induced DISEASE_D008107_liver_inflammation could be associated with the perturbation of the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions.
28476498	Molecular targets of CHEMICAL_C100187_chloropicrin in SPECIES_9606_human airway epithelial cells.
28476498	CHEMICAL_C100187_Chloropicrin is a vaporizing, irritating compound that causes complications in the respiratory system when inhaled.
28476498	In this study, we examined the effects of exposure to CHEMICAL_C100187_chloropicrin for 24h on ultrastructure and global gene expression in primary SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial cells.
28476498	The treatment increased the number of round and shrunken cells, which detached from culture plates more readily than the untreated control cells.
28476498	Transmission electron microscopy revealed some swollen mitochondria and the appearance of autophagy/lysosome type of vacuoles in the treated cells.
28476498	However, the main alteration in the ultrastructure of the treated cells was the presence of aggregated and slightly deformed cytoskeleton structures.
28476498	Furthermore, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting indicated that cytoskeletal b-tubulin protein is a probable target of CHEMICAL_C100187_chloropicrin exposure.
28476498	Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed microarray data (fold change>  2 compared to controls considered) revealed that the top molecular functions were cell growth and proliferation.
28476498	The main enriched top canonical pathways identified by IPA were associated with GENE_8894_EIF2-signalling, protein ubiquitination pathway, glycolysis and DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction.
28476498	Furthermore, the main upstream regulators and their target genes were involved in cell growth and proliferation and cytoskeletal organization.
28476498	The alterations found here can be the core components of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity involved in the lung complications after CHEMICAL_C100187_chloropicrin exposure.
28476547	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A exposure in utero programs a sexually dimorphic estrogenic state of hepatic metabolic gene expression.
28476547	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) exposure in utero affects fetal development and metabolism leading to DISEASE_D009765_obesity.
28476547	However, the mechanisms are not well characterized.
28476547	We identified sexually dimorphic developmental programming of genes regulating metabolism in the liver after CHEMICAL__BPA exposure.
28476547	Pregnant SPECIES_10090_mice were treated with CHEMICAL__BPA on days 9-18 of gestation.
28476547	At six weeks, female offspring were ovariectomized; both sexes were subsequently treated with CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol (E2).
28476547	Fetal CHEMICAL__BPA exposure altered the expression of genes in liver, including those involved in CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and lipid metabolism, and transporters, in both sexes.
28476547	Adult gene expression in CHEMICAL__BPA-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice often resembled normal adult response to E2 stimulation<sub>,</sub>even in the absence of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen treatment.
28476547	CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen receptor alpha and beta gene expression was upregulated in females and downregulated in SPECIES_9606_males.
28476547	This is the first report demonstrating sexual dimorphism in liver after CHEMICAL__BPA exposure and our finding of estrogenization may explain the CHEMICAL__BPA-related increase in incidence of DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disorders and DISEASE_D009765_obesity.
28476633	DNA methylation in lung tissues of SPECIES_10090_mouse offspring exposed in utero to CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons.
28476633	CHEMICAL_D011084_Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons (CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs) comprise an important class of environmental pollutants that are known to cause DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer in animals and are suspected lung carcinogens in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28476633	Moreover, evidence from cell-based studies points to CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs as modulators of the epigenome.
28476633	The objective of this work was to assess patterns of genome-wide DNA methylation in lung tissues of adult offspring initiated in utero with the transplacental PAH carcinogens CHEMICAL_C041517_dibenzo_def_p_chrysene (CHEMICAL__DBC) or CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (GENE_11331_BaP).
28476633	Genome-wide methylation patterns for normal (not exposed), normal adjacent and DISEASE_D008175_lung_tumor tissues obtained from adult offspring were determined using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) with the NimbleGen SPECIES_10090_mouse DNA methylation CHEMICAL__CpG island array.
28476633	DISEASE_D008175_Lung_tumor incidence in 45-week old SPECIES_10090_mice initiated with GENE_10090)_BaP was 32%, much lower than that of the CHEMICAL__DBC-exposed offspring at 96%.
28476633	Also, SPECIES_9606_male offspring appeared more susceptible to GENE_11331_BaP as compared to females.
28476633	Distinct patterns of DNA methylation were associated with non-exposed, normal adjacent and DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinoma lung tissues, as determined by principal components, hierarchical clustering and gene ontology analyses.
28476633	From these methylation profiles, a set of genes of interest was identified that includes potential important targets for epigenetic modification during the process of lung tumorigenesis in animals exposed to environmental CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs.
28478275	Identifying environmental chemicals as agonists of the GENE_367_androgen_receptor by using a quantitative high-throughput screening platform.
28478275	The GENE_367_androgen_receptor (GENE_367_AR, GENE_367_NR3C4) is a nuclear receptor whose main function is acting as a transcription factor regulating gene expression for SPECIES_9606_male sexual development and maintaining accessory sexual organ function.
28478275	It is also a necessary component of female fertility by affecting the functionality of ovarian follicles and ovulation.
28478275	Pathological processes involving GENE_367_AR include DISEASE_D055534_Kennedy_s_disease and DISEASE_D007713_Klinefelter_s_syndrome, as well as prostate, ovarian, and DISEASE_D009369_testicular_cancer.
28478275	Strict regulation of sex hormone signaling is required for normal reproductive organ development and function.
28478275	Therefore, testing small molecules for their ability to modulate GENE_367_AR is a first step in identifying potential endocrine disruptors.
28478275	We screened the GENE_9760_Tox21 10K compound library in a quantitative high-throughput format to identify activators of GENE_367_AR using two reporter gene cell lines, DISEASE_D013734_AR b-lactamase (DISEASE_D013734_AR-bla) and DISEASE_D013734_AR-luciferase (GENE_367_AR-luc).
28478275	Seventy-five compounds identified through the primary assay were characterized as potential agonists or inactives through confirmation screens and secondary assays.
28478275	Biochemical binding and GENE_367_AR nuclear translocation assays were performed to confirm direct binding and activation of GENE_367_AR from these compounds.
28478275	The top seventeen compounds identified were found to bind to GENE_367_AR, and sixteen of them translocated GENE_367_AR from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.
28478275	Five potentially novel or not well-characterized GENE_367_AR agonists were discovered through primary and follow-up studies.
28478275	We have identified multiple GENE_367_AR activators, including known GENE_367_AR agonists such as CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, as well as novel/not well-known compounds such as CHEMICAL_C074191_prulifloxacin.
28478275	The information gained from the current study can be directly used to prioritize compounds for further in-depth toxicological evaluations, as well as their potential to disrupt the endocrine system via GENE_367_AR activation.
28477916	CHEMICAL_C007834_Genipin protects the liver from DISEASE_D007511_ischemia/reperfusion injury by modulating mitochondrial quality control.
28477916	DISEASE_D056486_Hepatic_ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury is closely linked to oxidative mitochondrial damage.
28477916	Since mitochondrial quality control (QC) plays a pivotal role in the recovery of impaired mitochondrial function, mitochondrial QC has emerged as a potential therapeutic target.
28477916	CHEMICAL_C007834_Genipin, an CHEMICAL__iridoid compound from Gardenia jasminoides, has been showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
28477916	In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective mechanism of CHEMICAL_C007834_genipin against IR-induced DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_injury, particularly focusing on mitochondrial QC.
28477916	Male C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice underwent DISEASE_D008107_liver_ischemia for 60min, followed by reperfusion for 6h.
28477916	CHEMICAL_C007834_Genipin (100mg/kg, i.p.)
28477916	or vehicle (10% CHEMICAL_D011136_Tween_80 in saline) was administrated to SPECIES_10090_mice 1h before DISEASE_D007511_ischemia.
28477916	Liver and blood samples were collected 6h after reperfusion.
28477916	Hepatic IR increased hepatocellular oxidative damage and induced DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction.
28477916	These phenomena were ameliorated by CHEMICAL_C007834_genipin.
28477916	Hepatic IR also increased the level of mitochondrial fission, such as GENE_10090)_dynamin_related_protein_1 and the level of GENE_10090)_PINK1 protein expression.
28477916	In contrast, hepatic IR decreased the levels of mitochondrial biogenesis related proteins (e.g., GENE_10090)_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_gamma_coactivator_1a_nuclear_respiratory_factor_1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A), mitophagy related proteins (e.g., Parkin), and fusion related protein (e.g., GENE_10090)_mitofusin_2).
28477916	Furthermore, hepatic IR decreased the levels of GENE_10090)_sirtuin1 protein and phosphorylation of CHEMICAL_D000667_AMP-activated protein kinase.
28477916	CHEMICAL_C007834_Genipin alleviated these IR-induced changes.
28477916	These data indicate that CHEMICAL_C007834_genipin protects against IR-induced DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_injury via regulating mitochondrial QC.

28477956	Oxidative damage and disturbance of antioxidant capacity by CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone and its metabolites in SPECIES_9606_human cells.
28477956	Mycotoxin contamination of foods and feeds represent a serious problem worldwide.
28477956	CHEMICAL_D015025_Zearalenone (CHEMICAL__ZEA) is a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium species.
28477956	This study explores oxidative cellular damage and intracellular defense mechanisms (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) in the DISEASE_D006528_hepatoma cell line HepG2 after exposure to CHEMICAL__ZEA and its metabolites (CHEMICAL__a_zearalenol, CHEMICAL_D003613_a_ZOL; CHEMICAL__b_zearalenol, CHEMICAL__b_ZOL).
28477956	Our results demonstrated that HepG2 cells exposed to CHEMICAL__ZEA, CHEMICAL_D003613_a_ZOL or CHEMICAL__b_ZOL at different concentrations (0, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 M) showed: (i) elevated ROS levels (1.5- to 7-fold) based on the formation of the highly fluorescent CHEMICAL_C037631_2_7_dichlorofluorescein (CHEMICAL__DCF), (ii) increased DNA damage measured by the comet assay (9-45% higher), (iii) decreased CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH levels and CAT activity (decreased by 54%-25% and by 62%-25% for CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH and CAT, respectively) and (iv) GPx and SOD activities (increased by 50%-90% and by 26%-70%, respectively), compared to untreated cells.
28477956	Our results suggest that mycotoxin-induced oxidative stress and damage may play a major role in the cytotoxic effects of CHEMICAL__ZEA and its metabolites.
28477956	CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH and endogenous enzymes function together in protecting cells from ROS and the consequent damage after mycotoxin exposure.
28477956	CHEMICAL__ZEA has a lower capacity to induce oxidative stress and damage in HepG2 cells than its metabolites at the tested concentrations.
28479099	Protective effect of CHEMICAL_D002726_Chlorogenic_acid against CHEMICAL_D008727_methotrexate induced oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis in SPECIES_10116_rat liver: An experimental approach.
28479099	CHEMICAL_D008727_Methotrexate (CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX) is a drug which is used to treat different types of DISEASE_D009369_cancers but hepatotoxicity limits its clinical use.
28479099	CHEMICAL_D002726_Chlorogenic_acid (CHEMICAL__CGA) is one of the most abundant naturally occurring CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols in the SPECIES_9606_human diet.
28479099	Here, we assessed the effect of CHEMICAL__CGA against CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced hepatotoxicity and investigated the underlying possible mechanisms in SPECIES_10116_Wistar_Rats.
28479099	SPECIES_10116_Rats were pre-treated with CHEMICAL__CGA (50 or 100  mg  kg/b.w) and administered a single dose of CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX (20  mg/kg, b.w.).
28479099	CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX caused hepatotoxicity as evidenced by significant increase in serum DISEASE_D064420_toxicity markers, histopathological changes.
28479099	decreased activities of anti-oxidant armory (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR) and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH content.
28479099	CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX significantly causes upregulation of GENE_10116)_iNOS, GENE_10116)_Cox_2, GENE_10116)_Bax and downregulation of GENE_10116)_Bcl_2 expressions, it causes higher caspase 3, 9 activities.
28479099	However CHEMICAL__CGA pretreatment alleviates the hepatotoxicity by decreasing the oxidative stress.
28479099	CHEMICAL__CGA inhibited GENE_10116)_Cox_2, GENE_10116)_iNOS, GENE_10116)_Bax, GENE_10116)_Bcl_2 and Caspases 3, 9 mediated DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis, and improve the histology induced by CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX.
28479099	Thus, these findings demonstrated the hepatoprotective nature of CHEMICAL__CGA by attenuating the pro-inflammatory and apoptotic mediators and improving antioxidant competence in hepatic tissue.
28479099	These results imply that CHEMICAL__CGA has perfective effect against CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28479099	Hence CHEMICAL__CGA supplementation might be helpful in abrogation of CHEMICAL_D008727_MTX DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28482072	Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced GENE_1649_CHOP Inhibits GENE_10891_PGC_1a and Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction in DISEASE_D003920_Diabetic_Embryopathy.
28482072	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the development of DISEASE_D009436_maternal_diabetes_induced_neural_tube_defects (DISEASE_D009436_NTDs).
28482072	ER stress-induced GENE_1649_C_EBP_homologous_protein (GENE_1649_CHOP) plays an important role in the pro-apoptotic execution pathways.
28482072	However, the molecular mechanism underlying ER stress- and GENE_1649_CHOP-induced neuroepithelium cell apoptosis in DISEASE_D003920_diabetic_embryopathy is still unclear.
28482072	Deletion of the GENE_1649_Chop gene significantly reduced maternal DISEASE_D003920_diabetes-induced DISEASE_D009436_NTDs.
28482072	GENE_1649_CHOP deficiency abrogated DISEASE_D028361_maternal_diabetes_induced_mitochondrial_dysfunction and neuroepithelium cell apoptosis.
28482072	Further analysis demonstrated that GENE_1649_CHOP repressed the expression of GENE_10891_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_y_coactivator_1a (GENE_10891_PGC_1a), an essential regulator for mitochondrial biogenesis and function.
28482072	Both GENE_1649_CHOP deficiency in vivo and knockdown in vitro restore high CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-suppressed GENE_10891_PGC_1a expression.
28482072	In contrast, GENE_1649_CHOP overexpression mimicked inhibition of GENE_10891_PGC_1a by high CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose.
28482072	In response to the ER stress inducer CHEMICAL_D014415_tunicamycin, GENE_10891_PGC_1a expression was decreased, whereas the ER stress inhibitor CHEMICAL_C075773_4_phenylbutyric_acid blocked high CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-suppressed GENE_10891_PGC_1a expression.
28482072	Moreover, maternal DISEASE_D003920_diabetes in vivo and high CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose in vitro promoted the interaction between GENE_1649_CHOP and the GENE_10891_PGC_1a transcriptional regulator GENE_1051_CCAAT_enhancer_binding_protein_b (GENE_1051_C_EBPb), and reduced GENE_1051_C_EBPb binding to the GENE_10891_PGC_1a promoter leading to markedly decrease in GENE_10891_PGC_1a expression.
28482072	Together, our findings support the hypothesis that maternal DISEASE_D003920_diabetes-induced ER stress increases GENE_1649_CHOP expression which represses GENE_10891_PGC_1a through suppressing the GENE_1051_C_EBPb transcriptional activity, subsequently induces DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction and ultimately results in DISEASE_D009436_NTDs.
28482050	Parallel assessment of the effects of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A and several of its analogs on the adult SPECIES_9606_human testis.
28482050	STUDY QUESTION: Are CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and CHEMICAL__BPA analogs (CHEMICAL__BPA-A) safe for SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_9606_human reproductive function?
28482050	SUMMARY ANSWER: The endocrine function of SPECIES_9606_human testes explants [assessed by measuring CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone and GENE_3640_insulin_like_factor_3 (GENE_3640_INSL3)] was impacted by exposure of the SPECIES_9606_human adult testis explants to CHEMICAL__BPA/CHEMICAL__BPA-A.
28482050	WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The few epidemiologic studies performed suggest that CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols have potential endocrine disruptive properties, but they did not identify clear and direct patterns of endocrine disruption.
28482050	STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Adult SPECIES_9606_human testis explants in culture were exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA and the analogs CHEMICAL__bisphenol_F (CHEMICAL__BPF), CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS), CHEMICAL__bisphenol_E (CHEMICAL__BPE), CHEMICAL_C492482_bisphenol_B (CHEMICAL__BPB) and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A diglycidyl ether (CHEMICAL__BADGE) at 10-9-10-5 M for 24 or 48 h. SPECIES_9606_PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: SPECIES_9606_Human adult testes were obtained from DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer SPECIES_9606_patients who had no hormone therapy, or from multiorgan SPECIES_9606_donors.
28482050	After ex vivo exposure to the investigated CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols, the measured outcomes were related to histopathology (gross morphology and germ cell viability determined by anti-caspase three immunohistochemistry), and the levels of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, GENE_3640_INSL3 and inhibin B were measured using immunoassays.
28482050	The levels of mRNA encoding key enzymes of CHEMICAL_22901_bisphenol biotransformation were investigated by quantitative PCR: GENE_7366_UGT2B15 CHEMICAL_D014530_UDP (glucuronosyltransferase two family, polypeptide GENE_4710_B15), GENE_2990_GUSB (GENE_2990_glucuronidase_beta), GENE_6817;6818_SULT1A1_and_3_sulfotransferase_family_1_A_member_1_and_3) and GENE_412_STS (CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid sulfatase).
28482050	MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A significant dose-dependent inhibition was found between CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels measured in the culture medium and concentrations of CHEMICAL__BPA (P = 0.00778 at 24 h and P = 0.0291 at 48 h), CHEMICAL__BPE (P = 0.039) and CHEMICAL__BPF (P = 0.00663).
28482050	The observed CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__BPA-A-induced inhibition of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production varied according to duration of exposure and CHEMICAL__BPA/CHEMICAL__BPA-A concentrations.
28482050	CHEMICAL__BPA (10-9 M; P < 0.05), CHEMICAL__BPB (10-9 M; P < 0.05), CHEMICAL__BPS (10-9 and 10-8 M; P < 0.05) and CHEMICAL__BADGE (10-5 M; P < 0.05) increased Leydig cell GENE_3640_INSL3 production.
28482050	By contrast, CHEMICAL__BPE dose dependently inhibited GENE_3640_INSL3 (P = 0.0372).
28482050	Conversely, Sertoli cell function (inhibin B) and germ cell viability were not significantly affected by either CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols.
28482050	LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A.
28482050	LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Environmental compounds cannot be deliberately administered to SPECIES_9606_men, justifying the use of an ex vivo approach.
28482050	A relatively low number of testes samples were available for analysis (n = 3, except for CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone secretion with n = 5).
28482050	The active concentrations of CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__BPA-A used in the study were higher than those found in SPECIES_9606_human biological fluids.
28482050	WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Under our experimental conditions, direct exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA or CHEMICAL__BPA-A can result in endocrine disturbance in the adult SPECIES_9606_human testis.

28482051	Biomarkers of DISEASE_D002908_Chronic_Acrolein_Inhalation Exposure in SPECIES_10090_Mice: Implications for SPECIES_4097_Tobacco Product-Induced DISEASE_D064420_Toxicity.
28482051	Exposure to SPECIES_4097_tobacco smoke, which contains several harmful and potentially harmful constituents such as CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein increases DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease (DISEASE_D002318_CVD) risk.
28482051	Although high CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein levels induce pervasive DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_injury, the effects of low-level exposure remain unknown and sensitive biomarkers of CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein toxicity have not been identified.
28482051	Identification of such biomarkers is essential to assess the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein present at low levels in the ambient air or in new SPECIES_4097_tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.
28482051	Hence, we examined the systemic effects of chronic (12   weeks) CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein exposure at concentrations similar to those found in SPECIES_4097_tobacco smoke (0.5 or 1   ppm).
28482051	CHEMICAL_D000171_Acrolein exposure in SPECIES_10090_mice led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in its urinary metabolite CHEMICAL_C001423_3_hydroxypropyl_mercapturic_acid (CHEMICAL__3_HPMA) with an attendant increase in pulmonary levels of the CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein-metabolizing enzymes, CHEMICAL__glutathione_S-transferase P and CHEMICAL_15693_aldose reductase, as well as several GENE_10090)_Nrf2-regulated antioxidant proteins.
28482051	Markers of DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_endoplasmic_reticulum_stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation were unchanged.
28482051	Exposure to CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein suppressed circulating levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and specific leukocyte subsets (eg, GR-1+ cells, GENE_930_CD19+ B-cells, CD4+ T-cells; GENE_3684_CD11b+ monocytes) whilst other subsets (eg, CD8+ cells, NK1.1+ cells, Ly6C+ monocytes) were unchanged.
28482051	Chronic CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein exposure did not affect systemic CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance, platelet-leukocyte aggregates or microparticles in blood.
28482051	These findings suggest that circulating levels of EPCs and specific leukocyte populations are sensitive biomarkers of DISEASE_D014947_inhaled_acrolein_injury and that low-level (<0.5   ppm) CHEMICAL_D000171_acrolein exposure (eg, in secondhand smoke, vehicle exhaust, e-cigarettes) could increase DISEASE_D002318_CVD risk by diminishing endothelium repair or by suppressing immune cells or both.
28482088	Editor's Highlight: Therapeutic Concentrations of Antidepressants Inhibit Pancreatic Beta-Cell Function via Mitochondrial Complex Inhibition.
28482088	DISEASE_D003920_Diabetes_mellitus risk is increased by prolonged usage of antidepressants (ADs).
28482088	Although various mechanisms are suggested for their diabetogenic potential, whether a direct effect of ADs on pancreatic b-cells is involved is unclear.
28482088	We examined this idea for 3 ADs: CHEMICAL_D017374_paroxetine, CHEMICAL_D002997_clomipramine and, with particular emphasis, CHEMICAL_D005473_fluoxetine, on insulin secretion, mitochondrial function, cellular bioenergetics, KATP channel activity, and caspase activity in SPECIES_10090_murine and SPECIES_9606_human cell-line models of pancreatic b-cells.
28482088	Metabolic assays showed that these ADs decreased the redox, oxidative respiration, and energetic potential of b-cells in a time and concentration dependent manner, even at a concentration of 100   nM, well within the therapeutic window.
28482088	These effects were related to inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and III.
28482088	Consistent with impaired mitochondrial function, CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate output was increased and insulin secretion decreased.
28482088	Neither CHEMICAL_D005473_fluoxetine, CHEMICAL_C032456_antimycin nor CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone could reactivate KATP channel activity blocked by CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose unlike the mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP.
28482088	Chronic, but not acute, AD increased oxidative stress and activated caspases, 3, 8, and 9.
28482088	A close agreement was found for the rates of oxidative respiration, CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate output and modulation of KATP channel activity in MIN6 cells with those of primary SPECIES_10090_murine cells; data that supports MIN6 as a valid model to study beta-cell bioenergetics.
28482088	To conclude, CHEMICAL_D017374_paroxetine, CHEMICAL_D002997_clomipramine and CHEMICAL_D005473_fluoxetine were all cytotoxic at therapeutic concentrations on pancreatic beta-cells; an action suggested to arise by inhibition of mitochondrial bioenergetics, oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis.
28482088	These actions help explain the diabetogenic potential of these ADs in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28483554	Downregulation of GENE_10090)_miR_192 causes DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis and lipid accumulation by inducing GENE_10090)_SREBF1: Novel mechanism for CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A-triggered DISEASE_D065626_non_alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease.
28483554	Exposure to CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) has been associated with the development of DISEASE_D065626_nonalcoholic_fatty_liver_disease (DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD) but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
28483554	Given that microRNA (miRNA) is recognized as a key regulator of lipid metabolism and a potential mediator of environmental cues, this study was designed to explore whether exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA-triggered abnormal DISEASE_D005234_steatosis and lipid accumulation in the liver could be modulated by GENE_10090)_miR_192.
28483554	We showed that male post-weaning C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to 50 g/kg/day of CHEMICAL__BPA by oral gavage for 90days displayed a DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD-like phenotype.
28483554	In addition, we found in SPECIES_10090_mouse liver and SPECIES_9606_human HepG2 cells that CHEMICAL__BPA-induced DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis and lipid accumulation were associated with decreased expression of GENE_406967_miR_192, upregulation of GENE_6720_SREBF1 and a series of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis.
28483554	Downregulation of GENE_10090)_miR_192 in CHEMICAL__BPA-exposed hepatocytes could be due to defective pre-GENE_10090)_miR_192 processing by GENE_10090)_DROSHA.
28483554	Using HepG2 cells, we further confirmed that GENE_10090)_miR_192 directly acted on the 3'UTR of GENE_10090)_SREBF1, contributing to dysregulation of lipid homeostasis in hepatocytes.
28483554	GENE_10090)_MiR_192 mimic and lentivirus-mediated overexpression of GENE_10090)_miR_192 improved CHEMICAL__BPA-induced DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis by suppressing GENE_10090)_SREBF1.
28483554	Lastly, we noted that lipid accumulation was not a strict requirement for developing insulin resistance in SPECIES_10090_mice after CHEMICAL__BPA treatment.
28483554	In conclusion, this study demonstrated a novel mechanism in which DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD associated with CHEMICAL__BPA exposure arose from alterations in the GENE_10090)_miR_192-GENE_10090)_SREBF1 axis.
28483571	CHEMICAL_C010330_Sinigrin attenuates the progression of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis in GENE_10090)_ApoE(-/-) SPECIES_10090_mice fed a high-CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol diet potentially by inhibiting GENE_10090)_VCAM_1 expression.
28483571	DISEASE_D050197_Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease associated with elevated levels of atherogenic molecules for leukocyte recruitment.
28483571	CHEMICAL_C010330_Sinigrin (CHEMICAL__2_propenylglucosinolate) is found mainly in broccoli, brussels sprouts, and SPECIES_3710_black_mustard seeds.
28483571	Recently, CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin has received attention for its role in disease prevention and health promotion.
28483571	In this study, we examined the effect of CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin on development of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis in GENE_10090)_ApoE(-/-) SPECIES_10090_mice and the expression of adhesion molecules in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
28483571	The serum concentrations of CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride (TG), total CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium (CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_), and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced by CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin treatment in GENE_10090)_ApoE(-/-) SPECIES_10090_mice.
28483571	In addition, oral administration of CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin attenuated the mRNA expression of GENE_10090)_vascular_cell_adhesion_molecule_1 (GENE_10090)_VCAM_1), GENE_10090)_intercellular_adhesion_molecule_1 (GENE_10090)_ICAM_1), GENE_10090)_C_C_motif_chemokine_ligand_2 (GENE_10090)_CCL2), and GENE_10090)_CCL5 on aorta tissues and GENE_10090)_3_hydroxy_3_methylglutaryl_coenzyme_A_reductase (GENE_10090)_HMGR), GENE_10090)_liver_X_receptor (GENE_10090)_LXR), GENE_10090)_sterol_regulatory_element_binding_protein_2 (GENE_10090)_SREBP_2), and GENE_10090)_low_density_lipoprotein_receptor (GENE_10090)_LDLR) on liver tissues in GENE_10090)_ApoE(-/-) SPECIES_10090_mice.
28483571	To provide a potential mechanism underlying the action of CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin, we evaluated the in  vitro effect of CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin on the expression of the GENE_10090)_VCAM_1 in GENE_10090)_TNF_a-induced VSMCs.
28483571	The increased expression of GENE_10090)_VCAM_1 by GENE_10090)_TNF_a stimulation was significantly suppressed by the treatment of CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin (1-100   g/ml) and CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kB and the phosphorylation of GENE_10090)_p38_MAPK and JNK pathways, suggesting that CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin decreases the GENE_10090)_TNF_a-stimulated GENE_10090)_VCAM_1 expression through the suppression of NF-kB and MAP kinases signaling pathways.
28483571	Overall, CHEMICAL_C010330_sinigrin has the potential to be used in reducing the risks of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28483572	Early energy metabolism-related molecular events in skeletal muscle of DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats: The effects of CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine and SOD mimic.
28483572	Considering the vital role of skeletal muscle in control of whole-body metabolism and the severity of long-term DISEASE_D003920_diabetic complications, we aimed to reveal the molecular pattern of early DISEASE_D003920_diabetes_related_skeletal_muscle phenotype in terms of energy metabolism, focusing on regulatory mechanisms, and the possibility to improve it using two redox modulators, CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine and CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic.
28483572	ACHEMICAL__lloxan-induced DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats (120  mg/kg) were treated with CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine or the highly specific SOD mimic, CHEMICAL_C121876_M40403, for 7 days.
28483572	As appropriate controls, non-DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats received the same treatments.
28483572	We found that CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine and CHEMICAL_C121876_M40403 restored DISEASE_D003920_diabetes-induced DISEASE_D003072_impairment_of_phospho_5'-AMP-activated protein kinase a (AMPKa) signaling by upregulating AMPKa protein itself and its downstream effectors, GENE_10116)_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_y_coactivator_1a_and_nuclear_respiratory_factor_1.
28483572	Also, there was a restitution of the protein levels of oxidative phosphorylation components (complex I, complex II and complex IV) and GENE_10116)_mitofusin_2.
28483572	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine and CHEMICAL_C121876_M40403 induced translocation of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporter 4 to the membrane and upregulation of protein of phosphofructokinase and CHEMICAL_D000214_acyl_coenzyme_A dehydrogenase, diminishing negative DISEASE_D003920_diabetic effects on limiting factors of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and lipid metabolism.
28483572	Both treatments abolished DISEASE_D003920_diabetes-induced downregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium-ATPase proteins (GENE_116601;29693_SERCA_1_and_2).
28483572	Similar effects of CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine and SOD mimic treatments suggest that disturbances in the CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide/CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide ratio may be responsible for skeletal muscle mitochondrial and metabolic DISEASE_D003920_impairment_in_early_diabetes.
28483572	Our results provide evidence that CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine and SOD mimics have potential in preventing and treating metabolic disturbances accompanying this widespread metabolic disease.
28487374	Dioxin-induced increase in CHEMICAL_D007975_leukotriene_B4 biosynthesis through the CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor and its relevance to hepatotoxicity owing to neutrophil infiltration.
28487374	Dioxin and related chemicals alter the expression of a number of genes by activating the CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptors (GENE_10116)_AHR) to produce a variety of disorders including hepatotoxicity.
28487374	However, it remains largely unknown how these changes in gene expression are linked to DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28487374	To address this issue, we initially examined the effect of CHEMICAL__2_3_7_8_tetrachrolodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD), a most toxic CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin, on the hepatic and serum metabolome in male pubertal SPECIES_10116_rats and found that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD causes many changes in the level of CHEMICAL_D005227_fatty_acids, CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids, CHEMICAL_D000596_amino_acids, and their metabolites.
28487374	Among these findings was the discovery that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD increases the content of CHEMICAL_D007975_leukotriene_B4 (CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4), an inducer of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation due to the activation of leukocytes, in the liver of SPECIES_10116_rats and SPECIES_10090_mice.
28487374	Further analyses suggested that an increase in CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4 comes from a dual mechanism consisting of an induction of CHEMICAL_32395_arachidonate lipoxygenase-5, a rate-limiting enzyme in CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4 synthesis, and the down-regulation of GENE_10116)_LTC4_synthase, an enzyme that converts LTA4 to LTC4.
28487374	The above changes required GENE_10116)_AHR activation, because the same was not observed in GENE_10116)_AHR knock-out SPECIES_10116_rats.
28487374	In agreement with CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4 accumulation, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD caused the marked infiltration of neutrophils into the liver.
28487374	However, deleting CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4 receptors (GENE_10116)_BLT1) blocked this effect.
28487374	A CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD-produced increase in the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers, including DISEASE_D056486_tumor_necrosis_factor_and_hepatic_damage, was also suppressed in GENE_10090)_BLT1-null SPECIES_10090_mice.
28487374	The above observations focusing on metabolomic changes provide novel evidence that CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD accumulates CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4 in the liver by an GENE_10116)_AHR-dependent induction of CHEMICAL_D007975_LTB4 biosynthesis to cause hepatotoxicity through neutrophil activation.
28483490	Nano-sized CHEMICAL_D007501_iron particles may induce multiple pathways of cell death following generation of mistranscripted RNA in SPECIES_9606_human corneal epithelial cells.
28483490	CHEMICAL_D007501_Iron is closely associated with an ambient particulate matters-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory_response_and_the_cornea that covers the front of the eye, is among tissues exposed directly to ambient particulate matters.
28483490	Prior to this study, we confirmed that nano-sized CHEMICAL_D007501_iron particles (FeNPs) can penetrate the DISEASE_D065306_cornea.
28483490	Thus, we identified the toxic mechanism of FeNPs using SPECIES_9606_human corneal epithelial cells.
28483490	At 24h after exposure, FeNPs located inside autophagosome-like vacuoles or freely within SPECIES_9606_human corneal epithelial cells.
28483490	Level of inflammatory mediators including CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide, cytokines, and a chemokine was notably elevated accompanied by the increased generation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species.
28483490	Additionally, cell proliferation dose-dependently decreased, and level of multiple pathways of cell death-related indicators was clearly altered following exposure to FeNPs.
28483490	Furthermore, expression of gene encoding DNA binding protein inhibitor (1, 2, and 3), which are correlated to inhibition of the binding of mistranscripted RNA, was significantly down-regulated.
28483490	More importantly, expression of p-Akt and GENE_836_caspase_3 and conversion to LC3B-II from LC3B-I was enhanced by pretreatment with a GENE_834_caspase_1 inhibitor.
28483490	Taken together, we suggest that FeNPs may induce multiple pathways of cell death via generation of mistranscripted RNA, and these cell death pathways may influence by cross-talk.
28483490	Furthermore, we propose the need of further study for the possibility of tumorigenesis following exposure to FeNPs.
28484691	Inflammatory Effects of the Plant Protection Product Stifenia (CHEMICAL__FEN560) on Vertebrates.
28484691	Plant defense stimulators (PDSs) rely on the activation of plant innate immunity in order to protect crops against various pests.
28484691	These molecules are thought to be a safer alternative to classical plant protection products.
28484691	Given that innate immune systems share common features in plants and vertebrates, DISEASE_C563184_PDS can potentially cross-react with innate immunity of non-target organisms.
28484691	To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of the commercial DISEASE_C563184_PDS Stifenia (CHEMICAL__FEN560), which is composed of crushed fenugreek seeds.
28484691	We tested various concentrations of Stifenia (0.03-1   mg mL(-1)) on SPECIES_9606_human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and checked, 20   h later, cell metabolic activity (MA) using XTT assay, cell death by flow cytometry analysis, and GENE_3553_IL_1b inflammatory cytokine released in the culture medium using ELISA.
28484691	Stifenia induced a general decrease of the cell MA, which was concomitant with a dose-dependent release of GENE_3553_IL_1b.
28484691	Our results highlight the activation of SPECIES_9606_human immune cells.
28484691	The inflammatory effect of Stifenia was partially inhibited by pan-caspase inhibitor.
28484691	Accordingly, Stifenia induced the release of GENE_51673_p20 GENE_834_caspase_1 fragment into the culture medium suggesting the involvement of the GENE_114548_NLRP3 inflammasome.
28484691	Furthermore, we observed that Stifenia can induce cell death.
28484691	We also tested the effect of Stifenia on SPECIES_7955_Zebrafish larvae.
28484691	After 24   h of exposure, Stifenia induced a dose-dependent GENE_3553_IL_1b and GENE_7124_TNFa gene expression.
28484691	The SPECIES_9606_human-cell-based approach developed in this work revealed a high sensitivity concerning inflammatory properties of a plant protection product.
28484691	These tests could be routinely used to screen the potential adverse effects of this type of compounds.
28484691	Finally, our results suggest a potential danger of using extensively certain DISEASE_C563184_PDS for crop protection.
28495429	CHEMICAL_D013481_Superoxide-CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide genetic imbalance modulates differentially the oxidative metabolism on SPECIES_9606_human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to CHEMICAL__seleno_L_methionine.
28495429	CHEMICAL_D013481_Superoxide-CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide (S-HP) imbalance genetically caused by a gene polymorphism in the SPECIES_9606_human manganese CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase enzyme (CHEMICAL__Val16Ala_MnSOD) is associated with several diseases.
28495429	Into mitochondria, GENE_6648_MnSOD catalyses CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide radical producing HP and CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen.
28495429	Ala-GENE_6648_MnSOD genotype presents a high GENE_6648_MnSOD efficiency and generates the highest HP concentrations that has been associated with the risk of several DISEASE_D009369_cancer types.
28495429	Cellular selenoenzymes CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase and GENE_25824_thioredoxin_reductase (GENE_25824_TrxR) and catalase (CAT) are essential to HP removal produced in excess in cells.
28495429	Since, synthesis and activities of selenoenzymes are CHEMICAL_D012643_selenium dependent, we hypothesized that AA-GENE_6648_MnSOD cells could have an improvement on antioxidant status undergoing CHEMICAL__Seleno_L_methionine (CHEMICAL__SeMet) treatment.
28495429	This study performed an in  vitro protocol to evaluate the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) carriers of different PROTEINMUTATION_1799725_Val16Ala-GENE_6648_MnSOD genotypes exposed to CHEMICAL__SeMet.
28495429	CHEMICAL__SeMet effects on cell viability, apoptosis induction and modulation of oxidative variables were determined using spectrophotometric, flow cytometry, fluorimetric and immunoassays.
28495429	Gene modulation of antioxidant enzymes was also performed by qRT-PCR.
28495429	From an initial protocol using heterozygous (AV) cells was determined that 1nM CHEMICAL__SeMet presented a cytoprotective effect.
28495429	However, whereas this concentration did not change AA viability, in VV cells it was cytotoxic by increasing DISEASE_D009336_necrosis events.
28495429	CHEMICAL__SeMet induced higher selenoenzymes levels in AA and VV cells and decreased oxidative markers levels including DNA damage.
28495429	The results suggest a pharmacogenetic positive response of CHEMICAL__SeMet effect on AA-cells.
28495429	Future studies in  vivo could be essential to evaluate the potential clinical impact of S-HP imbalance after use of foods or supplements containing CHEMICAL__SeMet.
28495587	Dose-response analysis of epigenetic, metabolic, and DISEASE_D054549_apical_endpoints after short-term exposure to experimental hepatotoxicants.
28495587	Identification of sensitive and novel biomarkers or endpoints associated with DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis is of a high priority.
28495587	There is increasing interest in the incorporation of epigenetic and metabolic biomarkers to complement apical data; however, a number of questions, including the tissue specificity, dose-response patterns, early detection of those endpoints, and the added value need to be addressed.
28495587	In this study, we investigated the dose-response relationship between apical, epigenetic, and metabolomics endpoints following short-term exposure to experimental hepatotoxicants, CHEMICAL_D002994_clofibrate (CF) and CHEMICAL_D010634_phenobarbital (PB).
28495587	SPECIES_9606_Male F344 SPECIES_10116_rats were exposed to PB (0, 5, 25, and 100  mg/kg/day) or CF (0, 10, 50, and 250  mg/kg/day) for seven days.
28495587	Exposure to PB or CF resulted in dose-dependent increases in relative liver weights, hepatocellular DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy and proliferation, and increases in Cyp2b1 and Cyp4a1 transcripts.
28495587	These changes were associated with altered histone modifications within the regulatory units of cytochrome genes, LINE-1 DNA hypomethylation, and altered microRNA profiles.
28495587	Metabolomics data indicated alterations in the metabolism of CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids.
28495587	This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the apical, epigenetic and metabolic alterations, and suggests that the latter two occur within or near the dose response curve of apical endpoint alterations following exposure to experimental hepatotoxicants.
28495616	CHEMICAL_C076944_Salvianolic_acid_B attenuates CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin-induced ER stress by inhibiting GENE_10116)_TRPC3 and GENE_10116)_TRPC6 mediated CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ overload in SPECIES_10116_rat cardiomyocytes.
28495616	CHEMICAL_D004317_Doxorubicin (CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX)-induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity is a clinically complex syndrome that leads to significant DISEASE_D010146_pain to DISEASE_D009369_cancer survivors.
28495616	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to be an important contributor to myocardium dysfunction during this phenomenon.
28495616	Our previous study proved that CHEMICAL_C076944_Salvianolic_acid_B (CHEMICAL__Sal_B) protected against CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin induced DISEASE_D006331_cardiac_dysfunction by inhibiting ER stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
28495616	However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet clearly.
28495616	In this study, we investigated the protective effect and mechanisms of CHEMICAL__Sal_B againest CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX-induced DISEASE_D006331_cardiac_injury and ER stress in vivo and in vitro.
28495616	After pretreatment with CHEMICAL__Sal_B (0.25, 0.5, 1mg/kg i.v.)
28495616	for 7 days, male SD SPECIES_10116_rats were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX (3mg/kg) every 2 days for three injections.
28495616	The cardioprotective effect of CHEMICAL__Sal_B was observed 2 weeks after the first administration.
28495616	Adult SPECIES_10116_rat ventricular myocytes were isolated and treated with CHEMICAL__Sal_B (20 g/ml) for 6h and then exposed in CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX (1 m) for 4h.
28495616	The cardiomyocyte contractility and the level of intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ were determined.
28495616	CHEMICAL__Sal_B ameliorated CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX-induced apoptosis damage in heart tissues.
28495616	In vitro studies showed that CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX induced adult SPECIES_10116_rat ventricular myocytes contractile dysfunction and intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ handling derangement, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, raised the level of ER stress related proteins.
28495616	However, CHEMICAL__Sal_B pretreatment suppressed all of these adverse effects of CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX.
28495616	The effects of CHEMICAL__Sal_B were closely related to the inhibition of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, as characterized by inhibiting the expression of GENE_10116)_TRPC_3 and GENE_10116)_TRPC6.
28495616	These results indicate that CHEMICAL__Sal_B protects against CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX-induced cardiac apoptosis and ER stress via GENE_10116)_TRPC3 and GENE_10116)_TRPC6 inhibition.
28495853	Transgenerational transmission of DISEASE_D001249_asthma risk after exposure to environmental particles during pregnancy.
28495853	Exposure to environmental particles during pregnancy increases DISEASE_D001249_asthma susceptibility of the offspring.
28495853	We tested the hypothesis that this transmission continues to F2 and F3 generations and occurs via epigenetic mechanisms.
28495853	We compared allergic susceptibility of three generations of BALB/c offspring after a single maternal exposure during pregnancy to diesel exhaust particles or concentrated urban air particles.
28495853	After pregnant dams received intranasal instillations of particle suspensions or control, their F1, F2, and F3 offspring were tested in a low-dose ovalbumin protocol for sensitivity to DISEASE_D004342_allergic_asthma.
28495853	We found that the elevated susceptibility after maternal exposure to particles during pregnancy persists into F2 and, with lesser magnitude, into F3 generations.
28495853	This was evident from elevated eosinophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, histopathological changes of allergic DISEASE_D029424_airway_disease, and increased BAL levels of GENE_3567_IL_5 and GENE_3596_IL_13.
28495853	We have previously shown that dendritic cells (DCs) can mediate transmission of risk upon adoptive transfer.
28495853	Therefore, we used an enhanced reduced representation CHEMICAL_C042345_bisulfite sequencing protocol to quantify DNA methylation in DCs from each generation.
28495853	Distinct methylation changes were identified in F1, F2, and F3 DCs.
28495853	The subset of altered loci shared across the three generations were not linked to known DISEASE_D006967_allergy genes or pathways but included a number of genes linked to chromatin modification, suggesting potential interaction with other epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., histone modifications).
28495853	The data indicate that pregnancy airway exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) triggers a transgenerationally transmitted DISEASE_D001249_asthma susceptibility and suggests a mechanistic role for epigenetic alterations in DCs in this process.
28496032	GENE_9971_Farnesoid_X_receptor regulates the growth of renal adenocarcinoma cells without affecting that of a normal renal cell-derived cell line.
28496032	The GENE_9971_farnesoid_X_receptor (GENE_9971_FXR) is a CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid-activated nuclear receptor which is abundant in the liver, intestine, and kidney.
28496032	GENE_9971_FXR is a pivotal factor in CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol/CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid homeostasis but is involved in the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
28496032	In the present study, we investigated whether GENE_9971_FXR is also involved in the growth of renal adenocarcinoma cells.
28496032	The cell growth of renal adenocarcinoma cell line ACHN was inhibited by GENE_9971_FXR knockdown and stimulated by GENE_9971_FXR ligand, while that of a normal renal cell-derived cell line, HK-2, was not affected.
28496032	The carcinoma-specific stimulation of cell growth by GENE_9971_FXR was found to arise from down-regulation of GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_644914_p21/GENE_1026_Cip1 mRNA expression.
28496032	Our study showed that GENE_9971_FXR stimulates proliferation of renal adenocarcinoma cells and that GENE_9971_FXR knockdown is useful for growth suppression of renal adenocarcinoma without cytotoxicity to normal renal cells.
28499612	Environmentally relevant dose of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic interferes in functions of SPECIES_9606_human monocytes derived dendritic cells.
28499612	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic is a major environmental pollutant and highly hazardous toxin to SPECIES_9606_human health, which well established as carcinogen and immune deregulatory properties.
28499612	Dendritic cells (DCs) have a pivotal role in cell-mediated immunity for T-cell activation and antigen presentation.
28499612	In this study, T cell activation, some key functional genes expression, cell stability and phagocytosis capacity of SPECIES_9606_human monocytes derived DCs (MDDCs) were analyzed after in vitro exposure to very low dose of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic for 12 and 24h.
28499612	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic decreased continually phagocytosis capacity of MDDCs.
28499612	Furthermore, down-regulation of the cell-surface expression of the co-stimulatory molecule GENE_958_CD40 after 24h post treatment with CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic, confirmed CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic interferers in the phagocytosis process.
28499612	Pro inflammatory cytokines, GENE_3553_IL1b and GENE_7124_TNFa were more expressed in CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-treated MDDCs while GENE_3569_IL6 transiently was down regulated.
28499612	In general, our novel findings here strongly suggest that low level of DISEASE_D020261_arsenic_dysregulates four fundamental immune processes of DCs.
28499612	Mechanistically; this could explain the observed DISEASE_D007153_immunodeficiency activity of CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic, and give direction for comprehension the pathogenesis of CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic-induced diseases.
28500084	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A promotes hepatic lipid deposition involving Kupffer cells M1 polarization in male SPECIES_10090_mice.
28500084	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), one of the most common environmental endocrine disruptors, is considered to promote hepatic lipid deposition.
28500084	However, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated.
28500084	The polarization of Kupffer cells (KCs) plays an important role in hepatic DISEASE_D007249_inflammation by promoting pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype (M1KCs), which contributes to dysregulated lipid metabolism.
28500084	The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of KC polarization in CHEMICAL__BPA-induced hepatosteatosis in male SPECIES_10090_mice.
28500084	In this study, we examined hepatic lipid contents and quantified M1KC in CHEMICAL__BPA-treated GENE_10090)_CD1 SPECIES_10090_mice, and further explored the interaction between KCs and hepatocytes using conditional HepG2 cell culture.
28500084	CHEMICAL__BPA treatment significantly increased hepatic fat contents in GENE_10090)_CD1 SPECIES_10090_mice, accompanied by increased number of pro-inflammatory M1KCs and enhanced secretion of inflammatory cytokines.
28500084	Increased lipid contents were also observed in HepG2 cells treated with CHEMICAL__BPA.
28500084	Interestingly, higher TG contents were observed in HepaG2 cells treated with conditional media from CHEMICAL__BPA-treated KCs, compared with those treated with CHEMICAL__BPA directly.
28500084	Incubation of KCs with CHEMICAL__BPA promoted the polarization of KCs to pro-inflammatory M1 dominant subtypes, which was blocked by CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen antagonist CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI182780.
28500084	Taken together, our results revealed that M1KCs polarization is involved in CHEMICAL__BPA-induced hepatic fat deposition, which is possibly associated with the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor signaling pathway.
28506552	The natural CHEMICAL__terthiophene_a_terthienylmethanol induces S phase cell cycle arrest of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells via the generation of ROS stress.
28506552	DISEASE_D010051_Ovarian_cancer is the most lethal DISEASE_D009369_gynecological_malignancy worldwide.
28506552	CHEMICAL_D013876_Thiophenes such as CHEMICAL_C019101_terthiophene have been shown to have anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor effects on several DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell lines, including DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells.
28506552	However, the underlying mechanisms behind the anti-proliferative effect of CHEMICAL_D013876_thiophenes are poorly understood.
28506552	In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effect of CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol, a CHEMICAL_C019101_terthiophene isolated from SPECIES_53719_Eclipta_prostrata (False Daisy), on SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells.
28506552	We found that CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than is CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells.
28506552	CHEMICAL__a_Terthienylmethanol induces cell cycle arrest in DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells, as shown by the accumulation of cells in S phase.
28506552	In addition, CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol induced a change in S phase-related proteins GENE_890_cyclin_A, GENE_1017_cyclin_dependent_kinase_2, and GENE_894_cyclin_D2.
28506552	Knockdown of GENE_890_cyclin_A using specific siRNAs significantly compromised CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol-induced S phase arrest.
28506552	We further demonstrated that CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol induced an increase in intracellular ROS, and the antioxidant CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine significantly reversed the S phase arrest induced by CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol.
28506552	Moreover, CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol significantly increased the levels of p-H2AX, a DNA damage marker.
28506552	These results suggest that CHEMICAL__a_terthienylmethanol inhibits the growth of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells by S phase cell cycle arrest via induction of ROS stress and DNA damage.
28505145	DNA Methylation Targets Influenced by CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A and/or CHEMICAL_D019833_Genistein Are Associated with Survival Outcomes in Breast Cancer SPECIES_9606_Patients.
28505145	Early postnatal exposures to CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) and CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein (CHEMICAL__GEN) have been reported to predispose for and against mammary cancer, respectively, in adult SPECIES_10116_rats.
28505145	Since the changes in cancer susceptibility occurs in the absence of the original chemical exposure, we have investigated the potential of epigenetics to account for these changes.
28505145	DNA methylation studies reveal that prepubertal CHEMICAL__BPA exposure alters signaling pathways that contribute to carcinogenesis.
28505145	Prepubertal exposure to CHEMICAL__GEN and CHEMICAL__BPA + CHEMICAL__GEN revealed pathways involved in maintenance of cellular function, indicating that the presence of CHEMICAL__GEN either reduces or counters some of the alterations caused by the carcinogenic properties of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28505145	We subsequently evaluated the potential of epigenetic changes in the SPECIES_10116_rat mammary tissues to predict survival in breast cancer SPECIES_9606_patients via the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA).
28505145	We identified 12 genes that showed strong predictive values for long-term survival in CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor positive SPECIES_9606_patients.
28505145	Importantly, two genes associated with improved long term survival, GENE_10116)_HPSE and GENE_10116)_RPS9, were identified to be hypomethylated in mammary glands of SPECIES_10116_rats exposed prepuberally to CHEMICAL__GEN or to CHEMICAL__GEN + CHEMICAL__BPA respectively, reinforcing the suggested cancer suppressive properties of CHEMICAL__GEN.
28505368	Editor's Highlight: Farnesoid X Receptor Protects Against Low-Dose CHEMICAL_D002251_Carbon_Tetrachloride-Induced DISEASE_D056486_Liver_Injury Through the CHEMICAL_D013656_Taurocholate-GENE_5599_JNK Pathway.
28505368	Hepatotoxicity is of major concern for SPECIES_9606_humans exposed to industrial chemicals and drugs.
28505368	Disruption of farnesoid X receptor (GENE_10090)_FXR), a master regulator of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid (BA) metabolism, enhanced the sensitivity to DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in SPECIES_10090_mice after toxicant exposure, but the precise mechanism remains unclear.
28505368	In this study, the interconnection between BA metabolism, GENE_10090)_FXR, and chemically induced hepatotoxicity was investigated using metabolomics, GENE_10090)_Fxr-null SPECIES_10090_mice (GENE_10090)_Fxr-/-) and hepatocytes, and recombinant adenoviruses.
28505368	A single low-dose intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICAL_D002251_carbon_tetrachloride (GENE_10090)_CCl4), an inducer of acute DISEASE_D056486_hepatitis in SPECIES_10090_mice, resulted in more severe hepatocyte damage and higher induction of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as GENE_10090)_chemokine_C_C_motif_ligand_2 (GENE_10090)_Ccl2), in GENE_10090)_Fxr-/-.
28505368	Serum metabolomics analysis revealed marked increases in circulating CHEMICAL_D013656_taurocholate (CHEMICAL_30956_TCA) and CHEMICAL__tauro_b_muricholate (CHEMICAL__T_b_MCA) in these SPECIES_10090_mice, and forced expression of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_salt export protein (GENE_10090)_BSEP) by recombinant SPECIES_10535_adenovirus in GENE_10090)_Fxr-/- ameliorated GENE_6351_CCl4-induced DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage.
28505368	Treatment of GENE_9971_Fxr-null hepatocytes with CHEMICAL_30956_TCA, but not CHEMICAL__T_b_MCA, significantly increased GENE_5599_c_Jun_N_terminal_kinase (GENE_5599_JNK) activation and GENE_6347_Ccl2 mRNA levels, and up-regulation of GENE_6347_Ccl2 mRNA was attenuated by co-treatment with a GENE_5599_JNK inhibitor CHEMICAL_C432165_SP600125, indicating that CHEMICAL_30956_TCA directly amplifies hepatocyte inflammatory signaling mainly mediated by GENE_5599_JNK under DISEASE_D040181_FXR_deficiency.
28505368	Additionally, pretreatment with CHEMICAL_C432165_SP600125 or restoration of GENE_10090)_FXR expression in liver by use of recombinant SPECIES_10535_adenovirus, attenuated GENE_6351_CCl4-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28505368	Collectively, these results suggest that the CHEMICAL_30956_TCA-GENE_5599_JNK DISEASE_C566610_axis is likely associated with increased susceptibility to GENE_6351_CCl4-induced DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury in GENE_9971_Fxr-/-, and provide clues to the mechanism by which GENE_9971_FXR and its downstream gene targets, such as GENE_8647_BSEP, protects against chemically induced hepatotoxicity.
28512001	Low dose inflammatory potential of CHEMICAL_D012822_silica particles in SPECIES_9606_human-derived GENE_2736_THP_1 macrophage cell culture studies - Mechanism and effects of particle size and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron.
28512001	CHEMICAL_D012822_Silica and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron are major constituents in ambient particulate matter, and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron is a common impurity in many engineered nanomaterials.
28512001	The purpose of this work was to determine the pro-inflammatory and other biological effects and mechanism of particle size and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron presence under low dose, non-cytotoxic conditions that are likely to approximate actual exposure levels, in contrast with higher dose studies in which DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity occurs.
28512001	Specifically, SPECIES_9606_human-derived GENE_2736_THP_1 macrophages were exposed to 1   g/ml of pristine and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron-coated 50  nm and 2   m engineered CHEMICAL_D012822_silica nanoparticles.
28512001	Particles were first characterized for size, size distribution, surface area, CHEMICAL_D007501_iron concentration, phase and aggregation in cell culture media.
28512001	Then, biological assays were conducted to determine a non-lethal dose used in subsequent experiments.
28512001	CHEMICAL_D013481_Superoxide production, lipid peroxidation, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine (GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3553_IL_1b) mRNA expression were measured as a function of particle size and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron presence.
28512001	Smaller particle size and the presence of CHEMICAL_D007501_iron increased CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide production, lipid peroxidation, and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression.
28512001	Separate addition of an CHEMICAL_D007501_iron-chelator, a scavenger of CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide and CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide, and an inhibitor of CHEMICAL_D010713_phosphatidylcholine specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), suppressed the increase in cytokine mRNA expression.
28512001	Furthermore, free CHEMICAL_D007501_iron itself showed none of the aforementioned effects.
28512001	The results highlight the importance of particle size and CHEMICAL_D007501_iron in DISEASE_D011014_lung_inflammation for both natural and engineered nanomaterials, under low dose, non-toxic conditions, and support the role of an oxidant, lipid peroxidation and PC-PLC dependent inflammatory mechanism.
28506699	CHEMICAL__CRA(CHEMICAL__Crosolic_Acid) isolated from Actinidia valvata Dunn.Radix induces apoptosis of human DISEASE_D013274_gastric_cancer cell line BGC823 in  vitro via down-regulation of the NF-kB pathway.
28506699	A natural ursolic compound, CHEMICAL__2a_3b_dihydroxy_urs_12_en_28_oic_acid (CHEMICAL_C113861_corosolic_acid, CHEMICAL__CRA) was isolated from the root of Actinidia valvata Dunn.
28506699	(A.  valvata Radix).
28506699	Since a large number of CHEMICAL_36615_triterpenoid compound has marked anticancer effects toward various types of DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell lines in  vitro, this study was carried out to investigate the anticancer effect of CHEMICAL__CRA in human DISEASE_D013274_gastric_cancer cell line BGC823  cells and the underlying apoptotic mechanism of CHEMICAL__CRA was examined in BGC823  cell lines.
28506699	The results showed that CHEMICAL__CRA significantly suppressed the viability of BGC823  cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
28506699	CHEMICAL__CRA also significantly increased the sub G1 population by cell cycle analysis in a concentration dependent manner.
28506699	Exposure to CHEMICAL__CRA decreased p65, bcl-2, Fas, smac mRNA and protein expression, and increased IkBa, bax, survivin mRNA and protein expression.
28506699	Results of immunofluorescence staining and EMSA further indicated CHEMICAL__CRA induced apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear translocation of nuclear factor NF-kB subunit p65.
28506699	Consistently overall, our findings suggest that CHEMICAL__CRA induces apoptosis via inhibition of NF-kB (p65) expression level and activation of IkBa in BGC cells as a potent anticancer candidate for DISEASE_D013274_gastric_cancer treatment.
28506818	Measuring inhibition of CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine reuptake transporters by DISEASE_D019966_new_psychoactive_substances (DISEASE_D019966_NPS) in real-time using a high-throughput, fluorescence-based assay.
28506818	The prevalence and use of DISEASE_D019966_new_psychoactive_substances (DISEASE_D019966_NPS) is increasing and currently over 600 DISEASE_D019966_NPS exist.
28506818	Many illicit drugs and DISEASE_D019966_NPS increase brain CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine levels by inhibition and/or reversal of CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine reuptake transporters (DAT, NET and GENE_6532_SERT).
28506818	This is often investigated using labor-intensive, radiometric endpoint measurements.
28506818	We investigated the applicability of a novel and innovative assay that is based on a fluorescent CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine mimicking substrate.
28506818	DAT, NET or GENE_6532_SERT-expressing SPECIES_9606_human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were exposed to common drugs (CHEMICAL_D003042_cocaine, CHEMICAL__dl_amphetamine or CHEMICAL_D018817_MDMA), DISEASE_D019966_NPS (CHEMICAL_C040639_4_fluoroamphetamine, CHEMICAL_D019904_PMMA, CHEMICAL__a_PVP, CHEMICAL__5_APB, 2C-B, CHEMICAL_C000595926_25B_NBOMe, 25I-NBOMe or CHEMICAL_C569113_methoxetamine) or the CHEMICAL__antidepressant_fluoxetine.
28506818	We demonstrate that this fluorescent microplate reader-based assay detects inhibition of different transporters by various drugs and discriminates between drugs.
28506818	Most IC50 values were in line with previous results from radiometric assays and within estimated SPECIES_9606_human brain concentrations.
28506818	However, CHEMICAL_D010627_phenethylamines showed higher IC50 values on GENE_6532_hSERT, possibly due to experimental differences.
28506818	Compared to radiometric assays, this high-throughput fluorescent assay is uncomplicated, can measure at physiological conditions, requires no specific facilities and allows for kinetic measurements, enabling detection of transient effects.
28506818	This assay is therefore a good alternative for radiometric assays to investigate effects of illicit drugs and DISEASE_D019966_NPS on CHEMICAL_25375_monoamine reuptake transporters.
28511854	GENE_10116)_Acot1 is a sensitive indicator for GENE_10116)_PPARa activation after CHEMICAL_C023036_perfluorooctanoic_acid exposure in primary hepatocytes of SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28511854	CHEMICAL_C023036_Perfluorooctanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA) is one of the most commonly detected and persistent CHEMICAL__perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) found in the environment.
28511854	We found that cell viability and intracellular oxidant stress increased in primary SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocytes exposed to CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA (100 M CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA, 24h), and mitochondrial CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide increased from 6.25 M CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment group.
28511854	To screen for sensitive indicators in mRNA level, we investigated global transcriptome profile alteration after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposure using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in primary SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocytes, and identified 177 gene transcripts (158 upregulated, 19 downregulated) as significantly changed after exposure to 100 M of CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA for 24h (fold change >= 2, FDR<0.05).
28511854	Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) assays were conducted after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA treatment at various doses (0, 0.4, 1.56, 6.25, 25, and 100 M) and times (6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 96h).
28511854	GENE_10116)_Acot1 transcripts increased significantly in the 100 M CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA group (4500-fold) after 24h of exposure, and increased remarkably for all time points (24, 48, 72 and 96h) after exposure to 6.25 M. GENE_10116)_Acot1 also responded to lower CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA doses, with a significant increase found after exposure to 0.4 M for 96h.
28511854	These results imply GENE_10116)_Acot1 could serve as a sensitive indicator for GENE_10116)_PPARa activation after CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA exposure in primary SPECIES_10116_rat hepatocytes.
28526448	The CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol-CHEMICAL__O-methyltransferase inhibitors CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone and CHEMICAL_C071192_entacapone uncouple and inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain in HepaRG cells.
28526448	The GENE_10090)_catechol_O_methyltransferase inhibitor CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone causes hepatotoxicity and DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_damage in animal models.
28526448	We studied the interaction of CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone with mitochondrial respiration in comparison to CHEMICAL_C071192_entacapone in different experimental models.
28526448	In HepaRG cells (SPECIES_9606_human cell-line), CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone decreased the CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP content (estimated IC50 100  15 M) and was cytotoxic (estimated IC50 333  45 M), whereas CHEMICAL_C071192_entacapone caused no DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and no CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP depletion up to 200 M. Cytochrome P450 induction did not increase the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of the compounds.
28526448	In HepaRG cells, CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone (not CHEMICAL_C071192_entacapone) inhibited maximal DISEASE_C565375_complex_I_and_complex_II_linked_oxygen_consumption.
28526448	In intact SPECIES_10090_mouse liver mitochondria, CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone stimulated state 2 complex II-linked respiration and both compounds inhibited state 3 respiration of complex IV.
28526448	Mitochondrial uncoupling was confirmed for both compounds by stimulation of complex I-linked respiration in the presence of CHEMICAL_D009840_oligomycin.
28526448	Inhibition of complex I, II and IV for CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone and of complex I and IV for CHEMICAL_C071192_entacapone was directly demonstrated in disrupted SPECIES_10090_mouse liver mitochondria.
28526448	In HepaRG cells, CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was associated with increased CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate and ROS production and hepatocyte DISEASE_D009336_necrosis.
28526448	In conclusion, both compounds uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and inhibit mitochondrial enzyme complexes.
28526448	CHEMICAL_C066340_Tolcapone is a more potent mitochondrial toxicant than CHEMICAL_C071192_entacapone.
28526448	DISEASE_D028361_Mitochondrial_toxicity is a possible mechanism for CHEMICAL_C066340_tolcapone-associated hepatotoxicity.
28522335	Comparative analysis of transcriptomic responses to repeated-dose exposure to CHEMICAL__2_MCPD and CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD in SPECIES_10116_rat kidney, liver and testis.
28522335	CHEMICAL_D000517_3_Chloro_1_2_propanediol (CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD) and its isomer CHEMICAL__2_chloro_1_3_propanediol (CHEMICAL__2_MCPD) are heat-induced food contaminants present in oil- and fat-containing foodstuff.
28522335	Kidney and testes are among the main target organs of CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD.
28522335	Almost no data on CHEMICAL__2_MCPD DISEASE_D064420_toxicity are available.
28522335	Here, transcriptomic responses following repeated-dose exposure of SPECIES_10116_rats to non-toxic doses of 10  mg/kg body weight per day CHEMICAL__2_MCPD or CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD for 28 days were characterized by microarray analysis of kidney, liver, and testes.
28522335	CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD exerted more pronounced effects than CHEMICAL__2_MCPD in all organs.
28522335	The limited overlap between the datasets indicates that CHEMICAL__2_MCPD and CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD do not share the same molecular mechanisms of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28522335	By combining transcriptomic data with datasets on proteomic regulation by CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD, a comprehensive view on CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD-induced regulation of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose utilization and oxidative stress response was developed.
28522335	Bioinformatic analyses revealed that Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) signaling is likely to be involved in mediating the oxidative stress response to CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD.
28522335	In summary, this study for the first time presents data on alterations in global gene expression by two important food contaminants, CHEMICAL__2_MCPD and CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD.
28522335	Data demonstrate profound differences between the effects of the two compounds and substantially broaden our knowledge on molecular details of CHEMICAL_D000517_3_MCPD-induced disturbance of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose utilization and redox balance.
28522409	Neonatal exposure to CHEMICAL__17a_ethynyl_estradiol (EE) disrupts follicle development and reproductive hormone profiles in female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28522409	DISEASE_D064420_Toxic effects induced by exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during fetal and neonatal periods can be irreversible and exert effects throughout an animal's entire life.
28522409	Our previous study showed that neonatal exposure to CHEMICAL__17a_ethynyl_estradiol (EE) induced irregular estrous cycle in adults.
28522409	To uncover the reason for the delayed effect after neonatal exposure to EE, reproductive parameters including ovarian weight, ovarian steroidogenesis, and hormonal profiles were investigated in developing female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28522409	Ovarian weight decreased at postnatal days (PND) 14 and 21 after neonatal exposure to EE.
28522409	Ovarian histology at PND21 showed that the ratio of follicles with a diameter >300 m decreased and the ratio of follicles with a diameter of 100-150 m increased in EE-treated ovaries, indicating that neonatal exposure to DISEASE_D008607_EE_retarded follicular development.
28522409	Moreover, the expression of GENE_10116)_P450arom increased at PND14 and the expressions of inhibin/activin subunits bA and bB decreased at PND21 in EE-treated ovaries.
28522409	Consistent with the expression of GENE_10116)_P450arom, circulating levels of CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol increased at PND14 in EE-treated animals.
28522409	Furthermore, the circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) also increased at PND14 in the treated animals.
28522409	Although the expression of GENE_10116)_Kiss1 did not change in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus between controls and EE-treated SPECIES_10116_rats, the expression of GENE_10116)_Kiss1 was reduced in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus at PND14.
28522409	Based upon those results, we suggest that neonatal exposure to EE disrupted the system regulating the interactions between the reproductive hormones and follicle development in pre-pubertal SPECIES_10116_rats, which may result in reproduction dysfunction in adulthood.
28527913	GENE_10090)_Von_Willebrand_factor deficiency reduces DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28527913	DISEASE_D008107_Liver_diseases are associated with complex changes in the hemostatic system and elevated levels of the platelet-adhesive protein GENE_7450_Von_Willebrand_factor (GENE_7450_VWF) are reported in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D065290_acute_and_chronic_liver_damage.
28527913	Although elevated levels of GENE_10090)_VWF are associated with DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in the general population, the role of GENE_10090)_VWF in DISEASE_D056486_acute_and_chronic_liver_injury has not been examined in depth in experimental settings.
28527913	We tested the hypothesis that GENE_10090)_VWF deficiency inhibits experimental DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28527913	DISEASE_D017827_Wild_type (DISEASE_D017827_WT) and DISEASE_C531844_VWF_deficient SPECIES_10090_mice were challenged with CHEMICAL_D002251_carbon_tetrachloride (GENE_10090)_CCl4) and the impact of GENE_10090)_VWF deficiency on DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury and chronic DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis was determined.
28527913	DISEASE_C531844_VWF_deficiency did not significantly affect acute GENE_10090)_CCl4-induced hepatocellular DISEASE_D009336_necrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28527913	Chronic GENE_10090)_CCl4 challenge, twice weekly for 6weeks, significantly increased hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen deposition in livers of DISEASE_D017827_WT SPECIES_10090_mice.
28527913	Interestingly, hepatic induction of several profibrogenic and stellate cell activation genes was attenuated in GENE_10090)_VWF-deficient SPECIES_10090_mice.
28527913	Moreover, birefringent sirius red staining (indicating DISEASE_D003095_type_I_and_III_collagens) and type I collagen immunofluorescence indicated a reduction in hepatic collagen deposition in GENE_10090)_CCl4-exposed DISEASE_C531844_VWF_deficient SPECIES_10090_mice compared to GENE_10090)_CCl4-exposed DISEASE_D017827_WT SPECIES_10090_mice.
28527913	The results indicate that DISEASE_C531844_VWF_deficiency attenuates chronic GENE_10090)_CCl4-induced DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis without affecting DISEASE_D015882_acute_hepatocellular_necrosis.
28527913	The results are the first to demonstrate that GENE_10090)_VWF deficiency reduces the progression of DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis, suggesting a mechanistic role of elevated plasma GENE_10090)_VWF levels in DISEASE_D005355_cirrhosis.
28527916	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium stimulates metastasis-associated phenotype in triple-negative DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells through integrin and GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling.
28527916	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium (CHEMICAL__Cd) is a carcinogenic heavy metal which is implicated in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer development.
28527916	While the mechanisms of CHEMICAL__Cd-induced DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer initiation and promotion have been studied, the molecular processes involved in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer progression remain to be investigated.
28527916	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of CHEMICAL__Cd on metastasis-associated phenotypes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in triple-negative DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28527916	Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 1 M CHEMICAL__Cd increased cell spreading and cell migration.
28527916	This was associated with the activation of integrin b1, GENE_5747_FAK, GENE_6714_Src, and GENE_5879_Rac1.
28527916	Treatment with CHEMICAL__Cd also inhibited GENE_2932_GSK3b activity and induced T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (GENE_3172_TCF_LEF) transcription, indicating the involvement of GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling.
28527916	Furthermore, treatment with 3 M CHEMICAL__Cd for 4weeks increased the expression of GENE_1499_b_catenin and enhanced GENE_3172_TCF_LEF-mediated transcription.
28527916	Furthermore, enhanced expressions of integrins a5 and b1, paxillin, and GENE_7431_vimentin indicated that prolonged CHEMICAL__Cd treatment reorganized the cytoskeleton, which aided malignancy, as evidenced by enhanced matrix metalloprotease 2/9 (GENE_4313;4318_MMP2_9) secretion and cell invasion.
28527916	Prolonged CHEMICAL__Cd treatment also caused an increase in cell growth.
28527916	Together, these results indicate that CHEMICAL__Cd alters key signaling processes involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton to enhance DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell migration, invasion, adhesion, and proliferation.
28526263	CHEMICAL__N_stearoyl_l_Tyrosine inhibits the cell senescence and apoptosis induced by CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 in HEK293/Tau cells via the GENE_1269_CB2 receptor.
28526263	Although considerable energy and money have been spent trying to inhibit Ab production and its related metabolic enzyme activities, there are still no drug treatments available to cure even slow for DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease.
28526263	Therefore, tau protein has been focused recently as the new target for the treatment of DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease.
28526263	The transfected SPECIES_9606_human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells with or without CHEMICAL_36355_Tau 411 plasmid were used to evaluate the effect of tau protein on cell viability.
28526263	CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 was added to simulate microenvironment of DISEASE_D004194_oxidative_stress (DISEASE_D004194_OS) during aging.
28526263	CHEMICAL__N_stearoyl_l_tyrosine (CHEMICAL__Nstyr), one of the synthesized CHEMICAL_C078814_N_arachidonoylethanolamide analogues was administrated in HEK293/Tau cells during CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 insults.
28526263	Cellular senescence and tau aberrant modification appeared after tau transfection and aggravated by CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 insult which detected by b-galactosidase staining analysis and western blotting analysis.
28526263	The level of expression of GENE_596_Bcl_2 and the result of FCAS analysis indicated the appearance of cellular apoptosis.
28526263	The expression of prosenescence moleculars such as GENE_1029_p16-Rb and GENE_7157_P53 were induced by tau transfection in HEK293  cells.
28526263	Both GENE_1029_p16-Rb and GENE_7157_p53 senescent molecules were inhibited by CHEMICAL__Nstyr.
28526263	CHEMICAL_C103505_AM251 (1   M; an antagonist of CB1 cannabinoid receptor) or GENE_234826)_AM630 (1   M; an antagonist of GENE_1269_CB2 cannabinoid receptor) was used to offset the anti-senescence effects afforded by CHEMICAL__NsTyr.
28526263	The anti-senescence and anti-apoptosis effect of CHEMICAL__NsTyr was completely abolished by GENE_234826)_AM630.
28526263	Meanwhile, transfection of siRNACB2 was used to further confirm the above experimental results and it came out the similar results compared with GENE_234826)_AM630.
28526263	Taken together, our results suggest that DISEASE_D004194_oxidative_stress aggravates cellular senescence and apoptosis in HEK293/Tau, which can be reversed by CHEMICAL__Nstyr via GENE_1269_CB2 receptor.
28526328	CHEMICAL_D020106_Acrylamide-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in primary astrocytes and microglia: Roles of the GENE_10090)_Nrf2-ARE and NF-kB pathways.
28526328	CHEMICAL_D020106_Acrylamide (AA) is a common food contaminant formed during food heat processing that has DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxic effects.
28526328	We hypothesize that AA induces oxidative stress in astrocytes and microglia, leading to DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28526328	Oxidative status, translocation of GENE_10090)_Nrf2 and NF-kB, and related down-stream targets were measured in primary astrocytes and microglia obtained from BALB/c SPECIES_10090_mice.
28526328	The results showed that AA increased reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) formation and reduced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione levels, causing successive events associated with oxidative stress, including CHEMICAL_C027576_4_hydroxynonenal and CHEMICAL_C067134_8_hydroxy_2_deoxyguanosine adduct formation, in both cell types.
28526328	Both GENE_10090)_Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways were activated, but GENE_10090)_Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidative genes acted at earlier stages in both cell types before NF-kB activation.
28526328	After NF-kB activation, related cytokines, including GENE_10090)_IL_6, GENE_10090)_TNF_a, GENE_10090)_G_CSF, and GENE_10090)_IL_1b, were released and cell viability decreased.
28526328	Greater ROS generation, faster CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione reduction, and increased oxidative adduct formation were observed in microglia compared with astrocytes.
28526328	Moreover, GENE_10090)_Nrf2/NF-kB and its downstream genes were up-regulated much faster and to greater degrees in microglia than astrocytes.
28526328	These results clarify the roles of the GENE_10090)_Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways in AA-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28526328	These cellular responses may provide new insights for the development of adverse outcome pathway approaches for risk assessments of AA.
28532671	CHEMICAL_C025589_Ochratoxin_A transport by the SPECIES_9606_human GENE_9429_breast_cancer_resistance_protein (GENE_9429_BCRP), GENE_1244_multidrug_resistance_protein_2 (GENE_1244_MRP2), and organic anion-transporting polypeptides 1A2, 1B1 and 2B1.
28532671	CHEMICAL_C025589_Ochratoxin_A (CHEMICAL__OTA) is a fungal secondary metabolite that can contaminate various foods.
28532671	CHEMICAL__OTA has several toxic effects like nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in different animal species, but its mechanisms of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity are still unclear.
28532671	How CHEMICAL__OTA accumulates in kidney, liver, and brain is as yet unknown, but transmembrane transport proteins are likely involved.
28532671	We studied transport of CHEMICAL__OTA in vitro, using polarized MDCKII cells transduced with cDNAs of the efflux transporters SPECIES_10090_mouse (m)GENE_10090)_Bcrp, SPECIES_9606_human (h)GENE_9429_BCRP, GENE_10090)_mMrp2, or GENE_1244_hMRP2, and HEK293 cells overexpressing cDNAs of the SPECIES_9606_human uptake transporters GENE_6579_OATP1A2, GENE_10599_OATP1B1, GENE_28234_OATP1B3, or GENE_11309_OATP2B1 at pH7.4 and 6.4.
28532671	MDCKII-mBcrp cells were more resistant to CHEMICAL__OTA DISEASE_D064420_toxicity than MDCKII parental and GENE_9429_hBCRP-transduced cells.
28532671	Transepithelial transport experiments showed some apically directed transport by MDCKII-mBcrp cells at pH7.4, whereas both mBcrp and GENE_9429_hBCRP clearly transported CHEMICAL__OTA at pH6.4.
28532671	There was modest transport of CHEMICAL__OTA by GENE_10090)_mMrp2 and GENE_1244_hMRP2 only at pH6.4.
28532671	GENE_6579_OATP1A2 and GENE_11309_OATP2B1 mediated uptake of CHEMICAL__OTA both at pH7.4 and 6.4, but GENE_10599_OATP1B1 only at pH7.4.
28532671	There was no detectable transport of CHEMICAL__OTA by GENE_28234_OATP1B3.
28532671	Our data indicate that SPECIES_9606_human GENE_9429_BCRP and GENE_1244_MRP2 can mediate elimination of CHEMICAL__OTA from cells, thus reducing CHEMICAL__OTA DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28532671	On the other hand, SPECIES_9606_human GENE_6579_OATP1A2, GENE_10599_OATP1B1, and GENE_11309_OATP2B1 can mediate cellular uptake of CHEMICAL__OTA, which could aggravate CHEMICAL__OTA DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28527915	CHEMICAL_C015358_Methylparaben and CHEMICAL_C038091_butylparaben alter multipotent mesenchymal stem cell fates towards adipocyte lineage.
28527915	CHEMICAL__Paraben_esters_and_their_salts are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and foods.
28527915	We previously reported that CHEMICAL_D010226_parabens promoted adipocyte differentiation in vitro and increased adiposity but suppressed serum marker of bone formation in vivo.
28527915	Here, we investigated the effects of CHEMICAL_D010226_parabens (CHEMICAL_C015358_methylparaben and CHEMICAL_C038091_butylparaben) on modulating cell fate of multipotent stem cell line C3H10T1/2.
28527915	Both CHEMICAL_D010226_parabens modulated adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro.
28527915	CHEMICAL_C038091_Butylparaben markedly promoted adipogenic differentiation, but suppressed osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation whereas CHEMICAL_C015358_methylparaben showed similar but less pronounced effects.
28527915	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C038091_butylparaben, but not CHEMICAL_C015358_methylparaben, was shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) y whereas neither of the CHEMICAL__paraben was shown to activate GENE_10090)_glucocorticoid_receptor (GENE_10090)_GR) responsive reporter in C3H10T1/2 cells.
28527915	The adipogenic effects of CHEMICAL_C038091_butylparaben were significantly attenuated by PPARy knockdown, but not by GENE_10090)_GR knockdown.
28527915	In contrast, CHEMICAL__paraben's effects on osteoblast differentiation were affected by both knockdowns.
28527915	Collectively, the results demonstrate opposing effects of CHEMICAL_D010226_parabens on adipogenic and osteoblastogenic/chondrogenic differentiation of multipotent stem cells.
28527915	In light of the recent findings that CHEMICAL_D010226_parabens are detected in SPECIES_9606_human placenta and milk, our studies provide rationales to study CHEMICAL__paraben exposure during early development of life in the future.
28528080	Toxicological aspects of interesterified fat: DISEASE_D001927_Brain_damages in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28528080	In recent years, interesterified fat (IF) has been used to replace DISEASE_D018205_hydrogenated_vegetable_fat (DISEASE_D018205_HVF), rich in trans isomers, being found in processed foods.
28528080	Studies involving IF have shown deleterious influences on the metabolic system, similarly to DISEASE_D018205_HVF, whereas no studies regarding its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) were performed.
28528080	SPECIES_10116_Rats from first generation born and maintained under supplementation (3g/Kg, p.o.)
28528080	of SPECIES_3847_soybean-oil or IF until adulthood were assessed on memory, biochemical and molecular markers in the hippocampus.
28528080	IF group showed higher CHEMICAL_D005227_saturated_fatty_acids and CHEMICAL_D019787_linoleic_acid and lower CHEMICAL_28125_docosahexaenoic_acid incorporation in the hippocampus.
28528080	In addition, IF supplementation impaired short and long-term memory, which were related to increased reactive species generation and protein CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl levels, decreased catalase activity, GENE_10116)_BDNF and GENE_10116)_TrkB levels in the hippocampus.
28528080	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that lifelong IF consumption may be related to brain oxidative damage, DISEASE_D008569_memory_impairments and neurotrophins modifications, which collectively may be present indifferent DISEASE_D009422_neurological_disorders.
28528080	In fact, the use of IF in foods was intended to avoid damage from DISEASE_D018205_HVF consumption; however this substitute should be urgently reviewed, since this fat can be as harmful as trans fat.
28528741	In  vitro immune DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_C025589_ochratoxin_A in porcine alveolar macrophages: A role for the ROS-relative GENE_7099_TLR4/GENE_4615_MyD88 signaling pathway.
28528741	CHEMICAL_C025589_Ochratoxin_A (CHEMICAL__OTA) frequently contaminates a wide variety of food and feeds, inducing immune DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of animals.
28528741	However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
28528741	In the present study, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cell line 3D4/21 were chosen as a model, and treated by various concentrations of CHEMICAL__OTA.
28528741	The results showed that CHEMICAL__OTA induced immune DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of PAMs in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by cell viability, LDH release, GENE_308_Annexin_V/PI staining, GENE_596_Bcl_2/GENE_581_Bax mRNA ratio, and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression.
28528741	CHEMICAL__OTA increased intracellular ROS levels of PAMs by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.
28528741	CHEMICAL__NAC, a commonly used antioxidant, alleviated the CHEMICAL__OTA-induced increase of ROS production, apoptosis, and LDH release and decrease of cell viability.
28528741	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__OTA enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of GENE_7099_TLR4 and GENE_4615_MyD88 and the phosphorylation of GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2, GENE_5594_p38, and NF-kB p65.
28528741	Knockdown of GENE_7099_TLR4 by using a GENE_7099_TLR4-specific siRNA alleviated the CHEMICAL__OTA-induced immune DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28528741	These data indicate that CHEMICAL__OTA induced immune DISEASE_D064420_toxicity via ROS-relative GENE_7099_TLR4/GENE_4615_MyD88 signaling pathway in PAMs.
28528971	Regulatory effects of CHEMICAL_C097470_4_methoxychalcone on adipocyte differentiation through PPARy activation and reverse effect on GENE_10090)_TNF_a in 3T3-L1 cells.
28528971	CHEMICAL_D047188_Chalcones, the biosynthetic precursors of CHEMICAL_D005419_flavonoids and CHEMICAL_50753_isoflavonoids abundant in edible plants, possess a number of pharmacological properties, and there is growing evidence that CHEMICAL_D002599_chalcone derivatives inhibit GENE_10090)_TNF_a mediated insulin resistance.
28528971	The aim of the present study was to define the effects of CHEMICAL_C097470_4_methoxychalcone (CHEMICAL__4_MC) on adipocyte differentiation and to determine the underlying molecular mechanism.
28528971	We investigated the effects of CHEMICAL__4_MC on adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, and expression of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells.
28528971	Additionally, treatment with CHEMICAL__4_MC significantly increased the PPARy-induced transcriptional activity and CHEMICAL__4_MC also enhanced the DNA binding affinity of PPARy to the proliferator-activated receptor response elements (PPRE) at target promoters.
28528971	Next, we tested the effect of CHEMICAL__4_MC on the inhibition induced by GENE_10090)_TNF_a on adipocyte differentiation.
28528971	Treatment with CHEMICAL__4_MC enhanced the lipid accumulation and strongly up-regulated the expression of adipogenic markers, including PPARy, GENE_10090)_aP2, FAS, and GENE_10090)_adiponectin during adipocyte differentiation.
28528971	Finally, CHEMICAL__4_MC attenuated the inhibitory effect of GENE_10090)_TNF_a on adipocyte differentiation and GENE_10090)_adiponectin expression and subsequently regulated the expression and secretion of various adipokines that are involved in insulin sensitivity.
28528971	This study clearly demonstrates that CHEMICAL__4_MC enhanced adipocyte differentiation, in part, by its potent effects on PPARy activation and by its reverse effect on GENE_10090)_TNF_a.
28529118	Early life allergen and air pollutant exposures alter longitudinal blood immune profiles in SPECIES_9606_infant SPECIES_9544_rhesus_monkeys.
28529118	Early life is a critical period for the progressive establishment of immunity in response to environmental stimuli; the impact of airborne challenges on this process is not well defined.
28529118	In a longitudinal fashion, we determined the effect of episodic DISEASE_D008924_house_dust_mite (DISEASE_D008924_HDM) aerosol and CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone inhalation, both separately and combined, on peripheral blood immune cell phenotypes and cytokine expression from 4 to 25weeks of age in an SPECIES_9606_infant SPECIES_9544_rhesus_monkey model of childhood development.
28529118	Immune profiles in peripheral blood were compared with lung lavage at 25weeks of age.
28529118	Independent of exposure, peripheral blood cell counts fluctuated with chronologic age of animals, while IFNy and GENE_3565_IL_4 mRNA levels increased over time in a linear fashion.
28529118	At 12weeks of age, total WBC, lymphocyte numbers, GENE_50943_FoxP3 mRNA and IL-12 mRNA were dramatically reduced relative to earlier time points, but increased to a steady state with age.
28529118	Exposure effects were observed for monocyte numbers, as well as GENE_1232_CCR3, GENE_50943_FoxP3, and IL-12 mRNA levels in peripheral blood.
28529118	Significant differences in cell surface marker and cytokine expression were detected following in vitro DISEASE_D008924_HDM or CHEMICAL_60755_PMA/CHEMICAL_D015759_ionomycin stimulation of PBMC isolated from animals exposed to either DISEASE_D008924_HDM or CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone.
28529118	Lavage revealed a mixed immune phenotype of GENE_50943_FoxP3, IFNy and DISEASE_D004802_eosinophilia in association with combined DISEASE_D008924_HDM plus CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone exposure, which was not observed in blood.
28529118	Collectively, our findings show that airborne challenges during postnatal development elicit measureable cell and cytokine changes in peripheral blood over time, but exposure-induced immune profiles are not mirrored in the lung.
28533128	CHEMICAL_26195_Polyphenol inhibition of CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene-induced oxidative stress and DISEASE_D009369_neoplastic transformation in an in  vitro model of DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28533128	While dietary CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols are widely recognized for DISEASE_D009369_cancer-preventing characteristics, the relative effectiveness and mechanisms of action of different CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols is not clear.
28533128	In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of six different CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols against CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P)-induced oxidative stress and DISEASE_D009369_neoplastic transformation in the Bhas 42  cell DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis assay.
28533128	All of the CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols completely prevented the increased intracellular ROS generation by CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P at 12  h, and most inhibited after 3 days.
28533128	CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P increased mitochondrial CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide generation at 12  h, which was inhibited by the CHEMICAL_D000872_anthocyanins and CHEMICAL_D001599_berberine.
28533128	CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P increased expression of genes related to oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation (GENE_4780_Nrf2, GENE_7351_UCP2, and GENE_7124_TNF_a) after 24  h. CHEMICAL_D059808_Polyphenols strongly inhibited the increase in GENE_7124_TNF_a and also several CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols inhibited the increase in GENE_7351_UCP2.
28533128	At 21 days after 72  h treatment, CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P produced a large increase in the number of DISEASE_D009369_neoplastic colonies.
28533128	This transformation was inhibited by most CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols, and strongly by CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol.
28533128	In summary, all tested CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols were able to inhibit CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P-induced increases in markers of oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and to inhibit cellular transformation, with CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol being notable for the strongest preventive effect on cell transformation.
28533128	The results support a role for dietary CHEMICAL_D059808_polyphenols in protecting against CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P-induced DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28536007	Zuotai and CHEMICAL__HgS differ from CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2 and CHEMICAL_30785_methyl_mercury in CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg accumulation and DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in weanling and aged SPECIES_10116_rats.
28536007	CHEMICAL__Mercury_sulfides are used in Ayurvedic medicines, Tibetan medicines, and Chinese medicines for thousands of years and are still used today.
28536007	Cinnabar (CHEMICAL__a_HgS) and metacinnabar (b-CHEMICAL__HgS) are different from CHEMICAL__mercury_chloride (CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2) and CHEMICAL_30785_methylmercury (CHEMICAL__MeHg) in their disposition and DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28536007	Whether such scenario applies to weanling and aged animals is not known.
28536007	To address this question, weanling (21d) and aged (450d) SPECIES_10116_rats were orally given Zuotai (54% b-CHEMICAL__HgS, 30mg/kg), CHEMICAL__HgS (CHEMICAL__a_HgS, 30mg/kg), CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2 (34.6mg/kg), or CHEMICAL__MeHg (CHEMICAL_28216_MeHgCl, 3.2mg/kg) for 7days.
28536007	Accumulation of CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg in kidney and liver, and the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity-sensitive gene expressions were examined.
28536007	Animal body DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain was decreased by CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2 and to a lesser extent by CHEMICAL__MeHg, but unaltered after Zuotai and CHEMICAL__HgS.
28536007	CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2 and CHEMICAL__MeHg produced dramatic tissue CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg accumulation, increased kidney (GENE_10116)_kim_1 and GENE_10116)_Ngal) and liver (Ho-1) injury-sensitive gene expressions, but such changes are absent or mild after Zuotai and CHEMICAL__HgS.
28536007	Aged SPECIES_10116_rats were more susceptible than weanling SPECIES_10116_rats to CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28536007	To examine roles of transporters in CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg accumulation, transporter gene expressions were examined.
28536007	The expression of renal uptake transporters GENE_10116)_Oat1, GENE_10116)_Oct2, and GENE_10116)_Oatp4c1 and hepatic GENE_10116)_Oatp2 was decreased, while the expression of renal efflux transporter GENE_10116)_Mrp2, GENE_10116)_Mrp4 and GENE_10116)_Mdr1b was increased following CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2 and CHEMICAL__MeHg, but unaffected by Zuotai and CHEMICAL__HgS.
28536007	Thus, Zuotai and CHEMICAL__HgS differ from CHEMICAL_D008627_HgCl2 and CHEMICAL__MeHg in producing tissue CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg accumulation and DISEASE_D064420_toxicity, and aged SPECIES_10116_rats are more susceptible than weanling SPECIES_10116_rats.
28536007	Transporter expression could be adaptive means to reduce tissue CHEMICAL_D008628_Hg burden.
28536466	CHEMICAL_C082360_Fipronil-induced enantioselective developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity to SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryo-larvae involves changes in DNA methylation.
28536466	Enantioselectivity in the aquatic DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of chiral pesticides has been widely investigated, while the molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
28536466	Thus far, few studies has focused on genomic expression related to selective DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in chiral pesticide, nor on epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation.
28536466	Here, we used CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil, a broad-spectrum insecticide, as a model chemical to probe its enantioselective DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in embryo development.
28536466	Our results showed that CHEMICAL__S_fipronil caused severer developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in embryos.
28536466	The MeDIP-Seq analysis demonstrated that CHEMICAL__S_fipronil dysregulated a higher level of genomic DNA methylation than CHEMICAL__R_fipronil.
28536466	Gene Ontology analysis revealed that CHEMICAL__S_fipronil caused more differentially methylated genes that are involved in developmental processes.
28536466	Compared with CHEMICAL__R_fipronil, CHEMICAL__S_fipronil significantly disrupted 7 signaling pathways (i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinases, tight junctions, focal adhesion, transforming growth factor-b, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and the hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways) by hyper-methylation of developmentally related genes, which further induced the downregulation of those genes.
28536466	Together, these data suggest that differences in DNA methylation may partly explain the enantioselectivity of CHEMICAL_C082360_fipronil to SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryos.
28536466	The application of epigenetics to investigate the enantioselective DISEASE_D064420_toxicity mechanism of chiral chemicals would provide a further understanding of their stereoselectivity biological effects.
28535995	Inflammation-associated gene expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages induced by toxins from fungi common on damp building materials.
28535995	Most fungi that grow on damp building materials produce low molecular weight compounds, some of which are known to be toxic.
28535995	In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to some metabolites of fungi common on damp building materials would result in time-, dose-, and compound-specific responses in the production of various chemokines by RAW 264.7 cells.
28535995	Cell cultures were exposed to a 10<sup>-7</sup>M or 10<sup>-8</sup>M metabolite dose for 2, 4, 8 or 24h.
28535995	Metabolite concentrations used were based on those that might be expected in alveolar macrophages due to inhalation exposure from living or working in a damp building.
28535995	Compared to controls, exposure provoked significant time-, dose- and compound-specific responses manifest as differentially elevated secretion of three of nine cytokines tested in culture supernatant of treated cells.
28535995	The greatest number of cytokines produced in response to the metabolites tested were in CHEMICAL_C100395_andrastin_A-treated cells (GENE_1437_GM_CSF, GENE_7040_TGFb1, GENE_7124_Tnf_a) followed by CHEMICAL_C472987_koninginin_A (GENE_7040_TGFb1 and GENE_7124_Tnf_a) and CHEMICAL_C016657_phomenone (GENE_1437_GM_CSF, GENE_7040_TGFb1).
28535995	CHEMICAL_C019290_Chaetoglobosin_A, CHEMICAL_C539431_chaetomugilin_D and CHEMICAL__walleminone exposures each resulted in significant time-specific production of GENE_7124_Tnf_a only.
28535995	This investigation adds to a body of evidence supporting the role of low molecular weight compounds from damp building materials as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
28535995	Along with SPECIES_4751_fungal glucan and chitin, these compounds contribute to the non-allergy based respiratory outcomes for SPECIES_9606_people living and working in damp buildings.
28539244	CHEMICAL_D008345_Manganese exposure induces neuroinflammation by impairing mitochondrial dynamics in astrocytes.
28539244	Chronic CHEMICAL_D008345_manganese (CHEMICAL__Mn) exposure induces DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity, which is characterized by DISEASE_D010302_Parkinsonian_symptoms resulting from impairment in the extrapyramidal motor system of the basal ganglia.
28539244	Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are considered key pathophysiological features of CHEMICAL__Mn DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28539244	Recent evidence suggests astrocytes as a major target of CHEMICAL__Mn DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity since CHEMICAL__Mn accumulates predominantly in astrocytes.
28539244	However, the primary mechanisms underlying CHEMICAL__Mn-induced DISEASE_D008107_astroglial_dysfunction and its role in metal DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity are not completely understood.
28539244	In this study, we examined the interrelationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and astrocytic inflammation in CHEMICAL__Mn DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28539244	We first evaluated whether CHEMICAL__Mn exposure alters mitochondrial bioenergetics in cultured astrocytes.
28539244	Metabolic activity assessed by MTS assay revealed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 92.68 M CHEMICAL__Mn at 24h in primary SPECIES_10090_mouse astrocytes (PMAs) and 50.46 M in the SPECIES_9606_human astrocytic U373 cell line.
28539244	CHEMICAL__Mn treatment reduced mitochondrial mass, indicative of impaired mitochondrial function and biogenesis, which was substantiated by the significant reduction in mRNA of GENE_9927_mitofusin_2, a protein that serves as a ubiquitination target for mitophagy.
28539244	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__Mn increased mitochondrial circularity indicating augmented mitochondrial fission.
28539244	Seahorse analysis of bioenergetics status in CHEMICAL__Mn-treated astrocytes revealed that CHEMICAL__Mn significantly impaired the basal mitochondrial CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen consumption rate as well as the CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-linked respiration rate.
28539244	The effect of CHEMICAL__Mn on mitochondrial energy deficits was further supported by a reduction in CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production.
28539244	CHEMICAL__Mn-exposed primary astrocytes also exhibited a severely quiescent energy phenotype, which was substantiated by the inability of CHEMICAL_D009840_oligomycin to increase the extracellular acidification rate.
28539244	Since astrocytes regulate immune functions in the CNS, we also evaluated whether CHEMICAL__Mn modulates astrocytic inflammation.
28539244	CHEMICAL__Mn exposure in astrocytes not only stimulated the release of proinflammatory cytokines, but also exacerbated the inflammatory response induced by aggregated a-synuclein.
28539244	The novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, mito-CHEMICAL_C056165_apocynin, significantly attenuated CHEMICAL__Mn-induced inflammatory gene expression, further supporting the role of mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress in mediating astrogliosis.
28539244	Lastly, intranasal delivery of CHEMICAL__Mn in vivo elevated GENE_2670_GFAP and depressed TH levels in the olfactory bulbs, clearly supporting the involvement of astrocytes in CHEMICAL__Mn-induced dopaminergic DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28539244	Collectively, our study demonstrates that CHEMICAL__Mn drives proinflammatory events in astrocytes by impairing mitochondrial bioenergetics.
28544013	CHEMICAL_C045651__Epigallocatechin_3_gallate inhibits human angiotensin-converting enzyme activity through an autoxidation-dependent mechanism.
28544013	We investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by CHEMICAL_C045651__epigallocatechin_3_gallate (EGCg), a major tea CHEMICAL_D002392_catechin.
28544013	EGCg inhibited both the ACE activity in the lysate of human colorectal cancer cells and human recombinant ACE (rh-ACE) in a dose-dependent manner.
28544013	Co-incubation with CHEMICAL_D019287_zinc_sulfate showed no influence on the rh-ACE inhibition by EGCg, whereas it completely counteracted the inhibitory effect of CHEMICAL_D004492_ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid, a chelating-type ACE inhibitor.
28544013	Although CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide was produced by the autoxidation of EGCg, CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide itself had little effect on the ACE activity.
28544013	Conversely, the co-incubation of EGCg with CHEMICAL_22908_borate or CHEMICAL_D001205_ascorbic_acid significantly diminished the EGCg inhibition.
28544013	A redox-cycling staining experiment revealed that rh-ACE was covalently modified by EGCg.
28544013	A Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis indicated that EGCg inhibited the ACE activity in a non-competitive manner.
28544013	These results suggested that EGCg might allosterically inhibit the ACE activity through oxidative conversion into an electrophilic CHEMICAL_C004532_quinone.
28542535	A CHEMICAL_C012589_trichostatin_A expression signature identified by TempO-Seq targeted whole transcriptome profiling.
28542535	The use of gene expression signatures to classify compounds, identify efficacy or DISEASE_D064420_toxicity, and differentiate close analogs relies on the sensitivity of the method to identify modulated genes.
28542535	We used a novel ligation-based targeted whole transcriptome expression profiling assay, TempO-Seq  , to determine whether previously unreported compound-responsive genes could be identified and incorporated into a broad but specific compound signature.
28542535	TempO-Seq exhibits 99.6% specificity, single cell sensitivity, and excellent correlation with fold differences measured by RNA-Seq (R2 = 0.9) for 20,629 targets.
28542535	Unlike many expression assays, TempO-Seq does not require RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, or capture of targeted RNA, and lacks a 3' end bias.
28542535	To investigate the sensitivity of the TempO-Seq assay to identify significantly modulated compound-responsive genes, we derived whole transcriptome profiles from MCF-7 cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor CHEMICAL_C012589_Trichostatin_A (CHEMICAL_46024_TSA) and identified more than 9,000 differentially expressed genes.
28542535	The CHEMICAL_46024_TSA profile for MCF-7 cells overlapped those for HL-60 and PC-3 cells in the Connectivity Map (cMAP) database, suggesting a common CHEMICAL_46024_TSA-specific expression profile independent of baseline gene expression.
28542535	A 43-gene cell-independent CHEMICAL_46024_TSA signature was extracted from cMAP and confirmed in TempO-Seq MCF-7 data.
28542535	Additional genes that were not previously reported to be CHEMICAL_46024_TSA responsive in the cMAP database were also identified.
28542535	CHEMICAL_46024_TSA treatment of 5 cell types revealed 1,136 differentially expressed genes in common, including 785 genes not previously reported to be CHEMICAL_46024_TSA responsive.
28542535	We conclude that CHEMICAL_46024_TSA induces a specific expression signature that is consistent across widely different cell types, that this signature contains genes not previously associated with CHEMICAL_46024_TSA responses, and that TempO-Seq provides the sensitive differential expression detection needed to define such compound-specific, cell-independent, changes in expression.
28549617	Hematopathological alterations of major DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor cascade, vital cell cycle inhibitors and hematopoietic niche components in experimental DISEASE_D009190_myelodysplasia.
28549617	DISEASE_D009190_Myelodysplastic_syndrome (DISEASE_D009190_MDS) is a poorly understood dreadful DISEASE_D019337_hematopoietic_disorder that involves DISEASE_D004194_maturational_defect_and_abnormalities in blood cell production leading to DISEASE_D006402_dysplastic_changes_and_peripheral_blood_pancytopenia.
28549617	The present work aims in establishing the mechanistic relationship of the expressional alterations of major DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor cascade, vital cell cycle inhibitors and hematopoietic microenvironmental components with the disease pathophysiologies.
28549617	The study involves the development of DISEASE_C536108_N_N' Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) induced SPECIES_10090_mouse model of DISEASE_D009190_MDS, characterization of the disease with blood film and bone marrow smear studies, scanning electron microscopic observation, mitochondrial membrane potential determination, flowcytometric analysis of osteoblastic and vascular niche components along with the expressional study of cleaved caspase-3, GENE_10090)_PCNA, GENE_10090)_Chk_2, GENE_10090)_p53, GENE_10090)_Ndn, GENE_10090)_Gfi_1, GENE_10090)_Tie_2, GENE_10090)_Sdf_1, GENE_10090)_Gsk_3b, GENE_10090)_p18 and GENE_10090)_Myt_1 in the bone marrow compartment.
28549617	Dysplastic features were found in peripheral blood of DISEASE_D009190_MDS SPECIES_10090_mice which seemed to be the consequence of three marrow pathophysiological conditions viz; aberrant rise of cellular proliferation, increased apoptosis and crowding of abnormal blast population.
28549617	Expressional decline of the GENE_10090)_p53 cascade involving GENE_10090)_Chk_2, GENE_10090)_p53, GENE_10090)_Ndn, GENE_10090)_Gfi_1 along with the downregulation of major cell cycle inhibitors seemed to be associated with the hyper-proliferative nature of bone marrow cells during DISEASE_D009190_MDS.
28549617	Moreover the disruption of osteoblastic niche components added to the decreased hematopoietic quiescency.
28549617	Increased marrow vascular niche components signified the pre-malignant state of DISEASE_D009190_MDS.
28549617	Elevated cellular apoptosis and rise in the blast burden were also found to be associated with the GENE_10090)_p53 expression dependent collapsing of mitochondrial membrane potential and upregulation of GENE_10090)_Tie_2 respectively.
28549617	The study established the mechanistic correlation between the alterations of the mentioned signaling components and DISEASE_D019337_hematopoietic_anomalies during DISEASE_D009190_MDS which may be beneficial for the development of therapeutic strategies for the disease.
28549656	CHEMICAL_D019695_Glycyrrhizin and CHEMICAL_D006034_glycyrrhetinic_acid inhibits CHEMICAL_D015058_alpha_naphthyl_isothiocyanate-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury and CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid cycle disruption.
28549656	CHEMICAL_D015058_Alpha_naphthyl_isothiocyanate (CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT) is a common hepatotoxicant experimentally used to reproduce the pathologies of DISEASE_D056486_drug_induced_liver_injury in SPECIES_9606_humans, but the mechanism of its DISEASE_D064420_toxicity remains unclear.
28549656	To determine the metabolic alterations following CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT exposure, metabolomic analyses was performed by use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
28549656	Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of liver, serum, bile, ileum, and cecum of vehicle- and CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-treated SPECIES_10090_mice revealed significant alterations of individual CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids, including increased CHEMICAL_C031655_tauroursodeoxycholic_acid, CHEMICAL__taurohydrodeoxycholic_acid, CHEMICAL_D013655_taurochenodeoxycholic_acid, and CHEMICAL_D013657_taurodeoxycholic_acid, and decreased   -, CHEMICAL__b_and_tauro_a_b_murideoxycholic_acid, CHEMICAL_D019826_cholic_acid, and CHEMICAL_D013656_taurocholic_acid in the CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-treated groups.
28549656	In accordance with these changes, CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT treatment altered the expression of mRNAs encoded by genes responsible for the metabolism and transport of CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids and CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol.
28549656	Pre-treatment of CHEMICAL_D019695_glycyrrhizin (GL) and CHEMICAL_D006034_glycyrrhetinic_acid (GA) prevented CHEMICAL_35455_ANIT-induced DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage and reversed the alteration of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid metabolites and GENE_1581_Cyp7a1, GENE_29881_Npc1l1, GENE_4547_Mttp, and GENE_39_Acat2 mRNAs encoding CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid transport and metabolism proteins.
28549656	These results suggested that GL/GA could prevent DISEASE_D056486_drug_induced_liver_injury and ensuing disruption of CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid metabolism in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28549828	Deficiency of long isoforms of GENE_4779_Nfe2l1 sensitizes MIN6 pancreatic b cells to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28549828	Increasing evidence indicates that chronic inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure is associated with DISEASE_D003924_type_2_diabetes (DISEASE_D003924_T2D), a disease of growing prevalence.
28549828	Pancreatic b-cells were targeted and damaged by oxidative stress induced by CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28549828	We previously showed that GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_like_2 (GENE_4780_Nfe2l2)-deficient pancreatic b-cells were vulnerable to cell damage induced by oxidative stressors including CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite, due to a muted antioxidant response.
28549828	Like GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_like_2 (GENE_4780_NFE2L2), GENE_4779_NFE2L1 also belongs to the cap 'n' collar (CNC) basic-region CHEMICAL_25017_leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family, and regulates antioxidant response element (ARE) related genes.
28549828	Our prior work showed GENE_4779_NFE2L1 regulates CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic b-cells and isolated islets.
28549828	In the current study, we demonstrated that MIN6 cells with a specific knockdown of long isoforms of GENE_4779_Nfe2l1 (GENE_4779_L_Nfe2l1) by lentiviral shRNA (GENE_4779_Nfe2l1(L)-KD) were vulnerable to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced apoptosis and cell damage.
28549828	The expression levels of antioxidant genes, such as GENE_2729_Gclc, GENE_2730_Gclm and GENE_3162_Ho_1, and intracellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) levels were not different in Scramble and GENE_4779_Nfe2l1(L)-KD cells, while the expression of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic metabolism related-genes, such as GENE_9446_Gsto1, GENE_2944_Gstm1 and GENE_1728_Nqo1, increased in GENE_4779_Nfe2l1(L)-KD cells with or without CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite treatment.
28549828	The up-regulation of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic biotransformation genes was due to activated GENE_4780_NFE2L2 in GENE_4779_Nfe2l1(L)-KD MIN6 cells.
28549828	Furthermore, the level of intracellular CHEMICAL__monomethylarsenic (CHEMICAL_34840_MMA) was higher in GENE_4779_Nfe2l1(L)-KD MIN6 cells than in Scramble cells.
28549828	These results showed that deficiency of GENE_4779_L_Nfe2l1 in pancreatic b-cells increased susceptibility to acute CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity by promoting CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic biotransformation and intracellular CHEMICAL_34840_MMA levels.
28552514	CHEMICAL_D000535_Aluminum-induced molecular DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration: The protective role of CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein and SPECIES_3827_chickpea extract.
28552514	DISEASE_D020258_Neurotoxicity of CHEMICAL__Al is well established and linked to oxidative damage and DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration.
28552514	This study investigated the protective role of CHEMICAL_D019833_genistein (CHEMICAL__Gen) and SPECIES_3827_chickpea extract (CPE) against CHEMICAL_C010845_AlCl3-induced DISEASE_D019636_neurodegeneration.
28552514	HPLC analysis revealed that biochanin CHEMICAL__A_7_O_b_D_glucoside and CHEMICAL_C004541_biochanin_A are the major components of the CPE.
28552514	Gene expression of TNF-a, APP, BACE1, PSEN-2 and ER-b were assessed in brain extract using RT-PCR.
28552514	Also, NF-  B subunit P65 and COX-2 expression were evaluated by western blotting.
28552514	The cholinergic function, histological examination and oxidative status were also estimated.
28552514	The CHEMICAL_C010845_AlCl3 significantly up regulated the expression of the NF-  B subunit P65, COX-2, TNF- a, BACE1and APP while it significantly down regulated PSEN-2 and ER-b expression.
28552514	The activity of CHEMICAL_40574_acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and the oxidative stress parameters as well as the histological examination confirmed the deleterious effect of CHEMICAL_C010845_AlCl3.
28552514	The administration of either CPE or CHEMICAL__Gen attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited the amyloidogenesis and restored both the AChE activity and ER-b expression.
28552514	CHEMICAL__Gen and CPE also inhibited the oxidative stress and ameliorated the histological alterations.
28552514	Accordingly, the present study provides an insight on the molecular role of CHEMICAL__Gen and CPE as protective agents against DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_injury.
28552776	Differential sensitivities of cellular GENE_7507_XPA and GENE_142_PARP_1 to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite inhibition and CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc rescue.
28552776	CHEMICAL_C015001_Arsenite directly binds to the CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc finger domains of the DNA repair protein CHEMICAL_D011064_poly_ADP_ribose_ polymerase (GENE_142_PARP)-1, and inhibits GENE_142_PARP_1 activity in the base excision repair (BER) pathway.
28552776	GENE_142_PARP inhibition by CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite enhances ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced DNA damage in keratinocytes, and the increase in DNA damage is reduced by CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc supplementation.
28552776	However, little is known about the effects of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite and CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc on the CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc finger CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide excision repair (NER) DISEASE_D014983_protein_xeroderma_pigmentosum group A (GENE_7507_XPA).
28552776	In this study, we investigated the difference in response to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite exposure between GENE_7507_XPA and GENE_142_PARP_1, and the differential effectiveness of CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc supplementation in restoring protein DNA binding and DNA damage repair.
28552776	CHEMICAL_C015001_Arsenite targeted both GENE_7507_XPA and GENE_142_PARP_1 in SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes, resulting in CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc loss from each protein and a pronounced decrease in GENE_7507_XPA and GENE_142_PARP_1 binding to chromatin as demonstrated by Chip-on-Western assays.
28552776	CHEMICAL_D015032_Zinc effectively restored DNA binding of GENE_142_PARP_1 and GENE_7507_XPA to chromatin when CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc concentrations were equal to those of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28552776	In contrast, CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc was more effective in rescuing CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-augmented direct UVR-induced DNA damage than oxidative DNA damage.
28552776	Taken together, our findings indicate that CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite interferes with GENE_142_PARP_1 and GENE_7507_XPA binding to chromatin, and that CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc supplementation fully restores DNA binding activity to both proteins in the cellular context.
28552776	Interestingly, rescue of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-inhibited DNA damage repair by supplemental CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc was more sensitive for DNA damage repaired by the GENE_7507_XPA-associated NER pathway than for the GENE_142_PARP_1-dependent BER pathway.
28552776	This study expands our understanding of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite's role in DNA repair inhibition and co-DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28552778	The impact of CHEMICAL_D015025_Zearalenone on the meiotic progression and primordial follicle assembly during early oogenesis.
28552778	CHEMICAL_D015025_Zearalenone (CHEMICAL__ZEA) is a mycotoxin produced by SPECIES_5518_fusarium_graminearum.
28552778	It can cause abnormal reproductive function by acting as an environmental CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen.
28552778	Research has traditionally focused on acute and chronic injury on SPECIES_9606_mammalian reproductive capacity after CHEMICAL__ZEA treatment.
28552778	DISEASE_D002547_Little_research has been done studying the effects of CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure on early oogenesis.
28552778	In this study, we investigate the effects of CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure on meiotic entry, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and primordial follicle assembly during SPECIES_10090_murine early oogenesis.
28552778	The results show that CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure significantly decreased the percentage of CHEMICAL__diplotene stage germ cells, and made more germ cells remain at CHEMICAL__zygotene or CHEMICAL__pachytene stages.
28552778	Moreover, the mRNA expression level of meiosis-related genes was significantly reduced after CHEMICAL__ZEA treatment.
28552778	CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure significantly increased DNA-DSBs at the CHEMICAL__diplotene stage.
28552778	Meanwhile, DNA damage repair genes such as GENE_10090)_RAD51 and GENE_10090)_BRCA1 were activated.
28552778	Furthermore, maternal exposure to CHEMICAL__ZEA significantly decreased the number of primordial follicles in newborn SPECIES_10090_mouse ovaries.
28552778	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__ZEA exposure impairs SPECIES_10090_mouse female germ cell meiotic progression, DNA-DSBs, and primordial follicle assembly.
28552779	CHEMICAL_D009532_Nickel-induced GENE_3091_HIF_1a promotes DISEASE_D006130_growth_arrest and senescence in normal SPECIES_9606_human cells but lacks toxic effects in transformed cells.
28552779	CHEMICAL_D009532_Nickel is a SPECIES_9606_human carcinogen that acts as a DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia mimic by activating the transcription factor GENE_3091_HIF_1a and DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia-like transcriptomic responses.
28552779	DISEASE_D000860_Hypoxia and elevated GENE_3091_HIF_1a are typically associated with drug resistance in DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells, which is caused by increased drug efflux and other mechanisms.
28552779	Here we examined the role of GENE_3091_HIF_1a in uptake of soluble CHEMICAL__Ni_II_ and CHEMICAL__Ni_II_-induced cell fate outcomes using si/shRNA knockdowns and gene deletion models.
28552779	We found that GENE_3091_HIF_1a had no effect on accumulation of CHEMICAL__Ni_II_ in two transformed (SPECIES_9606_H460, A549) and two normal SPECIES_9606_human cell lines (IMR90, WI38).
28552779	The loss of GENE_3091_HIF_1a also produced no significant impact on GENE_7157_p53-dependent and GENE_7157_p53-independent apoptotic responses or clonogenic survival of CHEMICAL__Ni_II_-treated transformed cells.
28552779	In normal SPECIES_9606_human cells, GENE_3091_HIF_1a enhanced the ability of CHEMICAL__Ni_II_ to inhibit cell proliferation and cause a permanent DISEASE_D006130_growth_arrest (senescence).
28552779	Consistent with its growth-suppressive effects, GENE_3091_HIF_1a was important for upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitors GENE_1026_p21 (GENE_1026_CDKN1A) and GENE_3429_p27 (GENE_1027_CDKN1B).
28552779	Irrespective of GENE_3091_HIF_1a status, CHEMICAL__Ni_II_ strongly increased levels of MYC protein but did not change protein expression of the cell cycle-promoting phosphatase GENE_993_CDC25A or the CDK inhibitor GENE_1029_p16.
28552779	Our findings indicate that GENE_3091_HIF_1a limits propagation of CHEMICAL__Ni_II_-damaged normal cells, suggesting that it may act in a DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor-like manner during early stages of CHEMICAL__Ni_II_ carcinogenesis.
28552822	Changes in DNA methylation of erythroid-specific genes in K562 cells exposed to CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol in long term.
28552822	CHEMICAL_C034221_Catechol is one of CHEMICAL__phenolic metabolites of CHEMICAL_D001554_benzene that is a general occupational hazard and a ubiquitous environmental air pollutant.
28552822	CHEMICAL_C034221_Catechol also occurs naturally in fruits, vegetables and cigarettes.
28552822	Previous studies have revealed that 72h exposure to CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol improved CHEMICAL_D006427_hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells accompanied with elevated methylation in erythroid specific genes.
28552822	In present study, K562 cells were treated with 0, 10 or 20 M CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol for 1-4weeks, CHEMICAL_D006427_hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and the enhanced hemoglobin synthesis was relatively stable.
28552822	The mRNA expression of a-, b- and y-globin genes, erythroid heme synthesis enzymes PBGD and ALAS2, transcription factor GATA-1 and NF-E2 showed a significant increase in K562 cells exposed to 20 M CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol for 3w, and CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol enhanced CHEMICAL_D006427_hemin-induced mRNA expression of these genes.
28552822	Quantitative MassARRAY methylation analysis also confirmed that the exposure to CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol changed DNA methylation levels at several CHEMICAL__CpG sites in several erythroid-specific genes and their far upstream of regulatory elements.
28552822	These results demonstrated that long-term exposure to low concentration of CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol enhanced the CHEMICAL_D006427_hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, in which DNA methylation played a role by up-regulating erythroid specific genes.
28548306	Zanthoxylum avicennae extract enhances GENE_10090)_GSK_3b to attenuate GENE_1499_b_catenin via phosphatase 2A to block metastatic effects of HA22T cells and hepatocellular DISEASE_D002277_carcinoma xenografted SPECIES_10090_nude_mice.
28548306	DISEASE_D006528_Hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC) DISEASE_D009362_metastasis is often associated with the activation of Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling pathway.
28548306	Zanthoxylum avicennae (Ying Bu Bo, YBB), a traditional herb with hepatoprotective effect, has been proven to inhibit SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D006528_HCC in in vivo models however, the in vitro and in vivo effect of YBB on DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009362_metastasis is not clear yet.
28548306	To determine whether YBB could inhibit HA22T SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D006528_HCC cell by acting on GENE_1499_b_catenin metastatic signaling in vitro and in vivo, HA22T cells were treated with different concentrations of YBB extracts (YBBE) and analyzed by Immunofluorescence staining assay, western blot analysis, siRNA mediated gene knock-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation assay.
28548306	Additionally, the HA22T-implanted xenograft SPECIES_10090_nude_mice were used to confirm the assessed cellular effects.
28548306	SPECIES_10090_Mice treated with YBBEs showed a strong increasing trend in PP2Aca, GENE_10090)_GSK_3b, APC, and GENE_10090)_b_TrCP/HOS levels, however the expression of GENE_1499_b_catenin, p-GENE_10090)_GSK_3b, GENE_10090)_TBX_3, and GENE_10090)_IL8 proteins showed a decreasing trend.
28548306	YBBE significantly downregulated the nuclear and cytosolic GENE_1499_b_catenin levels by facilitating the proteosomal degradation of GENE_1499_b_catenin.
28548306	Moreover, as observed by co-immunoprecipitation assay, YBBE directly promoted the protein interactions between GENE_10090)_GSK_3b, GENE_10090)_b_TrCP, APC, GENE_10090)_PP2A, and GENE_1499_b_catenin.
28548306	In conclusion, both in vitro and in vivo models clearly demonstrated that YBBE inhibits GENE_1499_b_catenin involved metastatic signaling in highly metastatic HA22T cells through GENE_10090)_PP2A activation.
28548367	CHEMICAL_C574383_Sinularin induces oxidative stress-mediated G2/M arrest and apoptosis in DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer cells.
28548367	Soft corals-derived natural product, CHEMICAL_C574383_sinularin, was antiproliferative against some DISEASE_D009369_cancers but its effect and detailed mechanism on DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer cells remain unclear.
28548367	The subject of this study is to examine the antioral DISEASE_D009369_cancer effects and underlying detailed mechanisms in terms of cell viability, oxidative stress, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis analyses.
28548367	In MTS assay, CHEMICAL_C574383_sinularin dose-responsively decreased cell viability of three DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer cells (Ca9-22, GENE_150353_HSC_3, and CAL 27) but only little damage to oral normal cells (SPECIES_9606_HGF_1).
28548367	This cell killing effect was rescued by the antioxidant CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) pretreatment.
28548367	Abnormal cell morphology and induction of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) were found in CHEMICAL_C574383_sinularin-treated DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer Ca9-22 cells, however, CHEMICAL__NAC pretreatment also recovered these changes.
28548367	CHEMICAL_C574383_Sinularin arrested the Ca9-22 cells at G2/M phase and dysregulated the G2/M regulatory proteins such as GENE_983_cdc2 and GENE_891_cyclin_B1.
28548367	CHEMICAL_C574383_Sinularin dose-responsively induced apoptosis on Ca9-22 cells in terms of flow cytometry (annexin V and pancaspase analyses) and western blotting (GENE_142;836;841;842_caspases_3_8_9_and_poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase (GENE_142_PARP).
28548367	These apoptotic changes of CHEMICAL_C574383_sinularin-treated Ca9-22 cells were rescued by CHEMICAL__NAC pretreatment.
28548367	Taken together, CHEMICAL_C574383_sinularin induces oxidative stress-mediated antiproliferation, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis against DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer cells and may be a potential marine drug for antioral DISEASE_D009369_cancer therapy.
28549616	Pectin penta-oligogalacturonide reduces CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol accumulation by promoting CHEMICAL_3098_bile_acid biosynthesis and excretion in high-CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28549616	Haw pectin penta-oligogalacturonide (HPPS) has important role in improving CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol metabolism and promoting the conversion of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol to CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acids (BA) in SPECIES_10090_mice fed DISEASE_C538646_high_cholesterol_diet (DISEASE_C538646_HCD).
28549616	However, the mechanism is not clear.
28549616	This study aims to investigate the effects of HPPS on CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol accumulation and the regulation of hepatic BA synthesis and transport in DISEASE_C538646_HCD-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28549616	Results showed that HPPS significantly decreased plasma and hepatic TC levels but increased plasma high-density lipoprotein CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol (HDL-C) and GENE_10090)_apolipoprotein_A_I (GENE_10090)_apoA_I) levels, compared to DISEASE_C538646_HCD.
28549616	BA analysis showed that HPPS markedly decreased hepatic and small intestine BA levels but increased the gallbladder BA levels, and finally decreased the total BA pool size, compared to DISEASE_C538646_HCD.
28549616	Studies of molecular mechanism revealed that HPPS promoted hepatic GENE_10090)_ATP_binding_cassette_transporter_A1 (GENE_10090)_ABCA1), GENE_10090)_ATP_binding_cassette_transporter_G1 (GENE_10090)_ABCG1), and GENE_10090)_scavenger_receptor_BI (GENE_10090)_SR_BI) expression but did not affect ATB binding cassette transporter G5/G8 (GENE_27409;67470_ABCG5_8) expression.
28549616	HPPS inactivated hepatic GENE_10090)_farnesoid_X_receptor (GENE_10090)_FXR) and target genes expression, which resulted in significant increase of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase 1 (GENE_10090)_CYP7A1) and CHEMICAL_15889_sterol 12a-hydroxylase (GENE_10090)_CYP8B1) expression, with up-regulations of 204.2% and 33.5% for mRNA levels, respectively, compared with DISEASE_C538646_HCD.
28549616	In addition, HPPS markedly enhanced GENE_10090)_bile_salt_export_pump (GENE_10090)_BSEP) expression but didn't affect the CHEMICAL_D012964_sodium/CHEMICAL_D013656_taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (GENE_10090)_NTCP) expression.
28549616	In conclusion, the study revealed that HPPS reduced CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol accumulation by promoting BA synthesis in the liver and excretion in the feces, and might promote macrophage-to-liver DISEASE_C564766_reverse_cholesterol_transport (DISEASE_C564766_RCT) but did not liver-to-fecal DISEASE_C564766_RCT.
28552773	Voltage gated ion channels blockade is the underlying mechanism of BIMU8 induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity.
28552773	BIMU8 is a 5-HT4a receptor agonist and used as an experimental drug to counteract opioid induced DISEASE_D012131_respiratory_depression.
28552773	In preliminary experiments serious disturbances in ECG were observed in anesthetized SPECIES_9986_rabbits which prompted us to explore the underlying cause of BIMU8 induced abnormal changes in ECG recordings.
28552773	Electrophysiological experiments were performed on HEK-293 cells expressing GENE_2078_hERG, GENE_775_CaV1_2 and GENE_6331_NaV1_5 ion channels.
28552773	In whole-cell recordings BIMU8 effectively blocked these three channels, with IC50 values of 0.06  0.05, 1.46  0.26 and 4.66  0.58 M for GENE_2078_hERG, GENE_6331_NaV1_5 and GENE_775_CaV1_2, respectively.
28552773	Additionally it also produced a hyperpolarizing shift of 3.27mV in half maximal activation and 12.87mV in fast inactivation of GENE_6331_NaV1_5 channel.
28552773	These experimental findings indicate that BIMU8 is a potent blocker of GENE_2078_hERG, GENE_6331_NaV1_5 and GENE_775_CaV1_2 cardiac ion channels thus revealing its proarrhythmic potential.
28553957	Genetic association study of DISEASE_D017889_exfoliation_syndrome identifies a protective rare variant at LOXL1 and five new susceptibility loci.
28553957	DISEASE_D017889_Exfoliation_syndrome (DISEASE_D017889_XFS) is the most common known risk factor for secondary DISEASE_D005901_glaucoma and a major cause of DISEASE_D001766_blindness worldwide.
28553957	Variants in two genes, LOXL1 and CACNA1A, have previously been associated with DISEASE_D017889_XFS.
28553957	To further elucidate the genetic basis of DISEASE_D017889_XFS, we collected a global sample of DISEASE_D017889_XFS cases to refine the association at LOXL1, which previously showed inconsistent results across populations, and to identify new variants associated with DISEASE_D017889_XFS.
28553957	We identified a rare protective allele at LOXL1 (p.Phe407, odds ratio (OR) = 25, P = 2.9 * 10(-14)) through deep resequencing of DISEASE_D017889_XFS cases and controls from nine countries.
28553957	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of DISEASE_D017889_XFS cases and controls from 24 countries followed by replication in 18 countries identified seven genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 * 10(-8)).
28553957	We identified association signals at 13q12 (POMP), 11q23.3 (TMEM136), 6p21 (AGPAT1), 3p24 (RBMS3) and 5q23 (near SEMA6A).
28553957	These findings provide biological insights into the pathology of DISEASE_D017889_XFS and highlight a potential role for naturally occurring rare LOXL1 variants in disease biology.
28553959	Biallelic TRIP13 mutations predispose to DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumor and chromosome missegregation.
28553959	Through exome sequencing, we identified six individuals with biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TRIP13.
28553959	All six developed DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumor.
28553959	Constitutional mosaic DISEASE_D000782_aneuploidies, DISEASE_D008831_microcephaly, developmental delay and DISEASE_D012640_seizures, which are features of mosaic variegated DISEASE_C536987_aneuploidy_MVA_syndrome, were more variably present.
28553959	Through functional studies, we show that TRIP13-mutant patient cells have no detectable TRIP13 and have substantial impairment of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), leading to a high rate of chromosome missegregation.
28553959	Accurate segregation, as well as SAC proficiency, is rescued by restoring TRIP13 function.
28553959	Individuals with biallelic TRIP13 or BUB1B mutations have a high risk of DISEASE_D009369_embryonal_tumors, and here we show that their cells display severe DISEASE_D003072_SAC_impairment.
28553959	MVA due to biallelic CEP57 mutations, or of unknown cause, is not associated with DISEASE_D009369_embryonal_tumors and cells from these individuals show DISEASE_D002277_minimal_SAC_deficiency.
28553959	These data provide insights into the complex relationships between DISEASE_D000782_aneuploidy and DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28557068	Purification of CHEMICAL_D019298_glucose_6_phosphate dehydrogenase from rat (Rattus norvegicus) erythrocytes and inhibition effects of some metal ions on enzyme activity.
28557068	CHEMICAL_D019298_Glucose_6_phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first enzyme on which the CHEMICAL_D010428_pentose_phosphate pathway was checked.
28557068	In this study, purification of a G6PD enzyme was carried out by using rat erythrocytes with a specific activity of 13.7  EU/mg and a yield of 67.7 and 155.6-fold by using CHEMICAL_C045716_2_5_ADP Sepharose-4B affinity column chromatography.
28557068	For the purpose of identifying the purity of enzyme and molecular mass of the subunit, a CHEMICAL_D012967_sodium_dodecyl_sulfate-CHEMICAL_51135_polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out.
28557068	The molecular mass of subunit was calculated 56.5  kDa approximately.
28557068	Then, an investigation was carried out regarding the inhibitory effects caused by various metal ions (CHEMICAL_29033_Fe2_ , CHEMICAL_49807_Pb2_ , CHEMICAL_48775_Cd2_ , CHEMICAL_C004479_Ag_ , and CHEMICAL_37256_Zn2_ ) on G6PD enzyme activities, as per Beutler method at 340  nm under in vitro conditions.
28557068	Lineweaver-Burk diagrams were used for estimation of the IC50 and Ki values for the metals.
28557068	Ki values for CHEMICAL_49807_Pb_2 , CHEMICAL_48775_Cd_2 , CHEMICAL_C004479_Ag_ , and CHEMICAL__Zn+2 were 113.3, 215.2, 19.4, and 474.7   M, respectively.
28562019	Mass Spectrometric Characterization of Circulating Covalent Protein Adducts Derived from CHEMICAL_32955_Epoxide Metabolites of CHEMICAL_D002220_Carbamazepine in SPECIES_9606_Patients.
28562019	CHEMICAL_D002220_Carbamazepine (CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ) is an effective antiepileptic drug that has been associated with DISEASE_D004342_hypersensitivity reactions.
28562019	The pathogenesis of those reactions is incompletely understood but is postulated to involve a complex interplay between the drug's metabolism, genetic variation in human leukocyte antigens, and adverse activation of the immune system.
28562019	Multiple T-cell activation mechanisms have been hypothesized including activation by drug-peptide conjugates derived from proteins haptenated by reactive metabolites.
28562019	However, definitive evidence of the drug-protein adducts in SPECIES_9606_patients has been lacking.
28562019	In this study, mass spectrometry was used to characterize protein modifications by microsomally-generated metabolites of CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ and in SPECIES_9606_patients taking CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ therapy.
28562019	CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ 10,11-epoxide (CHEMICAL__CBZE), a major electrophilic plasma metabolite of CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ, formed adducts with CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-CHEMICAL__S-transferase pi (GENE_2950_GSTP; CHEMICAL_17561_Cys47) and human GENE_213_serum_albumin (HSA; His146 and His338, but not CHEMICAL_17561_Cys34) in vitro via notably divergent side-chain selectivity.
28562019	Both proteins were adducted at the same residues by undefined monoxygenated metabolites ([O]CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ) when they were incubated with SPECIES_9606_human liver microsomes, CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH and CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ.
28562019	There was also evidence for formation of a CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ adduct at His146 and His338 of HSA derived via dehydration from an intermediate CHEMICAL__arene_oxide adduct.
28562019	CHEMICAL_D005978_Glutathione trapping of reactive metabolites confirmed microsomal production of CHEMICAL__CBZE and indicated simultaneous production of CHEMICAL_37410_arene_oxides.
28562019	In 15 SPECIES_9606_patients prescribed CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ therapy, [O]CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ-modified HSA (His146) was detected in all subjects.
28562019	The relative amount of adduct was moderately positively correlated with plasma concentrations of CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ (r2 = 0.44, p = 0.002) and CHEMICAL__CBZE (r2 = 0.35, p = 0.006).
28562019	Our results have provided the first chemical evidence for microsomal production of [O]CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ species that are able to escape the microsomal domain to react covalently with soluble proteins.
28562019	This study has also demonstrated the presence of circulating [CHEMICAL__O]CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ-modified HSA in SPECIES_9606_patients without DISEASE_D004342_hypersensitivity reactions who were receiving standard CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ therapy.
28562019	The implications of those circulating adducts for susceptibility to CHEMICAL_D002220_CBZ DISEASE_D004342_hypersensitivity merit further immunological investigation in hypersensitive SPECIES_9606_patients.
28558994	GENE_5465_PPARa-independent transcriptional targets of CHEMICAL__perfluoroalkyl_acids revealed by transcript profiling.
28558994	CHEMICAL__Perfluoroalkyl_acids (CHEMICAL__PFAAs) are ubiquitous and persistent environmental contaminants.
28558994	Compounds such as CHEMICAL__perfluoroocanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA), CHEMICAL_C076994_perfluorooctane_sulfonate (CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS), CHEMICAL_C584865_perfluorononanoic_acid (CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA), and CHEMICAL_C471071_perfluorohexane_sulfonate (CHEMICAL__PFHxS) are readily found in the tissues of SPECIES_9606_humans and wildlife.
28558994	While CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA and CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS have been the subject of numerous studies since they were first described over a decade ago, less is known about the biological activity of CHEMICAL__PFHxS and CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA.
28558994	Most CHEMICAL__PFAAs are activators of GENE_5465_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_a (GENE_5465_PPARa), although the biological effects of these compounds are likely mediated by other factors in addition to GENE_5465_PPARa.
28558994	To evaluate the effects of CHEMICAL__PFHxS and CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA, SPECIES_9606_male wild-type and GENE_5465_Ppara-null SPECIES_10090_mice were dosed by oral gavage with CHEMICAL__PFHxS (3 or 10mg/kg/day), CHEMICAL_38397_PFNA (1 or 3mg/kg/day), or vehicle for 7days, and liver gene expression was evaluated by full-genome microarrays.
28558994	Gene expression patterns were then compared to historical in-house data for CHEMICAL_35549_PFOA and CHEMICAL_39421_PFOS in addition to the experimental hypolipidemic agent, CHEMICAL_C006253_WY_14_643.
28558994	While WY-14,643 altered most genes in a GENE_10090)_PPARa-dependent manner, approximately 11-24% of regulated genes in CHEMICAL__PFAA-treated SPECIES_10090_mice were independent of GENE_10090)_PPARa.
28558994	The possibility that CHEMICAL__PFAAs regulate gene expression through other molecular pathways was evaluated.
28558994	Using data available through a microarray database, PFAA gene expression profiles were found to exhibit significant similarity to profiles from SPECIES_10090_mouse tissues exposed to agonists of the constitutive activated receptor (GENE_10090)_CAR), CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor a (GENE_10090)_ERa), and PPARy.
28558994	SPECIES_9606_Human PPARy and GENE_2099_ERa were activated by all four CHEMICAL__PFAAs in trans-activation assays from the ToxCast screening program.
28558994	Predictive gene expression biomarkers showed that CHEMICAL__PFAAs activate GENE_9970_CAR in both genotypes and cause feminization of the liver transcriptome through suppression of GENE_6777_signal_transducer_and_activator_of_transcription_5B (GENE_6777_STAT5B).
28558994	These results indicate that, in addition to activating GENE_5465_PPARa as a primary target, CHEMICAL__PFAAs also have the potential to activate GENE_9970_CAR, PPARy, and GENE_2099_ERa as well as suppress GENE_6777_STAT5B.
28564578	Metabolic profiling of the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of CHEMICAL__Ginkgolic_acids in SPECIES_10116_rats using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-definition mass spectrometry.
28564578	CHEMICAL__Ginkgolic_acids (CHEMICAL__GAs) are thought to be the potentially hazardous constituents corresponding to the toxic side effects of SPECIES_3311_Ginkgo products.
28564578	In this study, toxicological and metabolomics studies of CHEMICAL__GAs were carried out by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-definition mass spectrometry (UPLC-HDMS).
28564578	Significant changes in serum clinical chemistry were observed in the both low (100  mg/kg) and high (900  mg/kg) doses.
28564578	Especially the serum enzyme of ALT, AST, LDH, and CK decreased in treated groups.
28564578	The histopathological observation demonstrated DISEASE_D008107_hepatic_steatosis_in_liver_and_tubular_vacuolar_degeneration in kidney.
28564578	These results demonstrated the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of CHEMICAL__GAs.
28564578	DISEASE_D028361_Functional_disorders are more likely to be toxic induced by CHEMICAL__GAs.
28564578	Metabolic profiling within seven days revealed the change of the body status after oral administration.
28564578	The results indicated the body function was significantly influenced at the 3rd day and could recover in seven days.
28564578	Metabolomic analysis showed alterations in 14 metabolites from plasma such as LysoPC(18:0), LysoPC(18:2) and other lipids.
28564578	The results suggested that exposure to CHEMICAL__GAs could cause disturbances in liver and kidney function associated with the metabolisms of lipids, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and the enzyme activity.
28565807	CHEMICAL_C006632_Arsenic_trioxide increases expression of GENE_6422_secreted_frizzled_related_protein_1 gene and inhibits the WNT/GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling pathway in Jurkat cells.
28565807	The aim of the present study was to investigate the demethylation effect of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3) on the GENE_6422_secreted_frizzled_related_protein_1 (GENE_6422_SFRP1) gene and its ability to inhibit the Wingless-type SPECIES_11757_MMTV integration site family (WNT) pathway in Jurkat cells.
28565807	Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the CHEMICAL__CpG island methylation status of the GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene in DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cell lines.
28565807	In addition, the effects on Jurkat cells of treatment with different concentrations of CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 for 48 h were investigated.
28565807	Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure the expression of mRNAs, while western blot analysis was used to examine protein expression in cells.
28565807	The GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene was methylated in Jurkat cells.
28565807	However, both methylated and unmethylated GENE_6422_SFRP1 genes were detected in HL60 and K562 cells.
28565807	In normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, the GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene was unmethylated.
28565807	Following treatment with CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 for 48 h, the GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene was demethylated, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of the GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene were increased.
28565807	By contrast, the mRNA and protein expression levels of GENE_1499_b_catenin and GENE_5111_cyclin Dl were downregulated.
28565807	The protein expression of GENE_4609_c_myc was also downregulated, but CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exhibited no significant effect on the mRNA expression of GENE_4609_c_myc.
28565807	Abnormal methylation of the GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene was detected in Jurkat cells.
28565807	These results suggest that CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 activates GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels in Jurkat cells by demethylation of the GENE_6422_SFRP1 gene.
28565807	Furthermore, they indicate that CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 regulates WNT target genes and controls the growth of Jurkat cells through the WNT/GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling pathway.
28571685	Activation of the CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor decreases CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin-induced GENE_1576_CYP3A4 expression in primary SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes and HepaRG.
28571685	The role of the cross-talk between nuclear receptors in the regulation of Cytochrome P450 expression in the liver is well-documented.
28571685	Most studies have focused on the cross-talk between the GENE_8856_pregnane_X_receptor (GENE_8856_PXR) and other receptors, such as the GENE_9970_constitutive_androstane_receptor.
28571685	However, cross-talk between PXRs and CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) has also been suggested, but reports regarding this cross-talk are conflicting.
28571685	In the present study, we treated HepaRG and primary SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes (PHHs) with both a strong (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) and weak (CHEMICAL_D012862_3_methylindole; CHEMICAL__3MI) GENE_196_AhR activator to investigate their impact on GENE_8856_PXR-regulated expression of GENE_1576_CYP3A4.
28571685	Moreover, we investigated the effect of co-activation of GENE_8856_PXR, using CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin, and GENE_196_AhR, using CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD and 3MI, on the regulation of GENE_1576_CYP3A4 induction.
28571685	We also investigated whether knockdown of GENE_196_AhR using siRNA affected the basal expression of GENE_8856_PXR and GENE_1576_CYP3A4 and induction of GENE_1576_CYP3A4 by CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD and 3MI.
28571685	The results showed that the treatment of HepaRG cells, but not of PHHs, with GENE_196_AhR activators decreased mRNA expression of GENE_1576_CYP3A4 and GENE_8856_PXR.
28571685	Moreover, in both HepaRG and PHHs, GENE_196_AhR activation decreased CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin-induced expression of GENE_1576_CYP3A4 mRNA.
28571685	Knock-down of GENE_196_AhR in PHHs increased both basal and CHEMICAL_D012293_rifampicin-induced expression of GENE_1576_CYP3A4 mRNA.
28571685	In conclusion, the presented results suggested that the cross-talk between GENE_8856_PXR and GENE_196_AhR plays a role in the regulation of GENE_1576_CYP3A4 gene expression.
28571686	Agonistic and antagonistic effects of CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates and their urinary metabolites on the CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormone receptors GENE_2099_ERa, GENE_2100_ERb, and AR.
28571686	CHEMICAL_C032279_Phthalate plasticizers have been reported to exert adverse effects via activation of the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors GENE_2099_ERa and GENE_2100_ERb and inhibition of the CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor AR as molecular initiating events.
28571686	After oral uptake, CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates are metabolized to their corresponding monoesters and subsequently to oxidized CHEMICAL__phthalate_monoester derivatives, which are in turn conjugated to CHEMICAL_D020723_glucuronic_acid and finally excreted with the urine.
28571686	In contrast to the parent CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates, toxicological data regarding their primary and secondary metabolites are rare.
28571686	The present study aimed at the characterization of potential endocrine effects of 15 CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates and 19 CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate metabolites by using reporter gene assays to monitor SPECIES_9606_human GENE_2099_ERa, GENE_2100_ERb, and AR activity.
28571686	In these in vitro assays, the CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates either stimulated or inhibited GENE_2099_ERa and GENE_2100_ERb activity and inhibited AR activity, whereas the CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate metabolites had no impact on the activity of these SPECIES_9606_human hormone receptors.
28571686	In contrast, the metabolites of CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP) stimulated transactivation of the SPECIES_9606_human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors GENE_5465_PPARa and GENE_5468_PPARy in analogous reporter gene assays, although CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP itself did not activate these nuclear receptors.
28571686	Therefore, primary and secondary CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate metabolites appear to exert different effects at the molecular level compared to the parent compounds.
28571770	GENE_3952_Leptin induces GENE_1385_CREB-dependent aromatase activation through GENE_5743_COX_2 expression in breast cancer cells.
28571770	GENE_3952_Leptin plays a key role in the control of adipocyte formation, as well as in the associated regulation of energy intake and expenditure.
28571770	The goal of this study was to determine if GENE_3952_leptin-induced aromatase enhances CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen production and induces tumor cell growth stimulation.
28571770	To this end, breast cancer cells were incubated with GENE_3952_leptin in the absence or presence of inhibitor pretreatment, and changes in aromatase and GENE_5743_cyclooxygenase_2 (GENE_5743_COX_2) expression were evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels.
28571770	Transient transfection assays were performed to examine the aromatase and GENE_5743_COX_2 gene promoter activities and immunoblot analysis was used to examine protein expression.
28571770	GENE_3952_Leptin induced aromatase expression, CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol production, and promoter activity in breast cancer cells.
28571770	Protein levels of CHEMICAL__phospho-GENE_6774_STAT3, PKA, GENE_207_Akt, GENE_5594_ERK, and JNK were increased by GENE_3952_leptin.
28571770	GENE_3952_Leptin also significantly increased CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP levels, CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP response element (CRE) activation, and GENE_1385_CREB phosphorylation.
28571770	In addition, GENE_3952_leptin induced GENE_5743_COX_2 expression, promoter activity, and increased the production of CHEMICAL_D015232_prostaglandin_E2.
28571770	Finally, a GENE_5743_COX_2 inhibitor and aromatase inhibitor suppressed GENE_3952_leptin-induced cell proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
28571770	Together, our data show that GENE_3952_leptin increased aromatase expression in breast cancer cells, which was correlated with GENE_5743_COX_2 upregulation, mediated through CRE activation and cooperation among multiple signaling pathways.
28572013	Comparison of in vitro toxicological effects of biomass smoke from different sources of animal dung.
28572013	Worldwide, over 4 million premature deaths each year are attributed to the burning of biomass fuels for cooking and heating.
28572013	Epidemiological studies associate household air pollution with DISEASE_D008171_lung_diseases, including DISEASE_D008175_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_lung_cancer, and DISEASE_D012141_respiratory_infections.
28572013	Animal dung, a biomass fuel used by economically vulnerable populations, generates more toxic compounds per mass burned than other biomass fuels.
28572013	The type of animal dung used varies widely depending on local agro-geography.
28572013	There are currently neither standardized experimental systems for dung biomass smoke research nor studies assessing the health impacts of different types of dung smoke.
28572013	Here, we used a novel reproducible exposure system to assess outcomes related to DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and DISEASE_D012141_respiratory_infections in SPECIES_9606_human airway cells exposed to six different types of dung biomass smoke.
28572013	We report that dung biomass smoke, regardless of species, is pro-inflammatory and activates the GENE_196_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor and GENE_5599_JNK transcription factors; however, dung smoke also suppresses interferon responses after a challenge with a viral mimetic.
28572013	These effects are consistent with epidemiological data, and suggest a mechanism by which the combustion of animal dung can directly cause DISEASE_D008171_lung_diseases, promote increased susceptibility to DISEASE_D007239_infection, and contribute to the global health problem of household air pollution.
28576465	CHEMICAL_D008687_Metformin and CHEMICAL_C040048_caffeic_acid regulate metabolic reprogramming in SPECIES_9606_human cervical carcinoma SPECIES_9606_SiHa/HTB-35  cells and augment anticancer activity of CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin via cell cycle regulation.
28576465	CHEMICAL_D008687_Metformin shows benefits in anticancer prevention in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28576465	In this study, normal SPECIES_9606_human fibroblasts (FB) and metastatic cervical cancer cells (SiHa) were exposed to 10 mM CHEMICAL_D008687_Metformin (CHEMICAL_16643_Met), 100  M CHEMICAL_C040048_Caffeic_Acid (CHEMICAL__trans_3_4_dihydroxycinnamic_acid, CA) or combination of the compounds.
28576465	Both drugs were selectively toxic towards cancer cells, but neither CHEMICAL_16643_Met nor CA treatment suppressed growth of normal cells.
28576465	CHEMICAL_16643_Met and CA regulated metabolic reprogramming in SPECIES_9606_SiHa tumor cells through different mechanisms: CHEMICAL_16643_Met suppressed regulatory enzymes Glurtaminase (GLS) and GENE_4199_Malic_Enzyme_1 (GENE_4199_ME1) and enhanced CHEMICAL_D019289_pyruvate oxidation via CHEMICAL_D014233_tricarboxylic_acids (CHEMICAL_30956_TCA) cycle, while CA acted as glycolytic inhibitor.
28576465	CHEMICAL_16643_Met/CA treatment impaired expression of CHEMICAL_15889_Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (GENE_6720_SREBP1c) which resulted in alleviation of de novo synthesis of CHEMICAL_27208_unsaturated_fatty_acid.
28576465	The toxic action of CHEMICAL__CisPt was supported by CHEMICAL_16643_Met and CA not only in tumor cells, but also during co-culture of SPECIES_9606_SiHa GFP+ cells with fibroblasts.
28576465	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_16643_Met and CA augmented CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin (CHEMICAL__CisPt) action against quiescent tumor cells involving reprogramming of cell cycle.
28576465	Our findings provide new insights into specific targeting of mitochondrial metabolism in neoplastic cells and into designing new CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin-based selective strategies for treating cervical cancer in SPECIES_9606_humans with regard to the role of tumor microenvironment.
28571773	CHEMICAL__DATS sensitizes glioma cells to GENE_8743_TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by up-regulation of GENE_8795_death_receptor_5 via ROS.
28571773	GENE_8743_Tumor_necrosis_factor_related_apoptosis_induced_ligand (GENE_8743_TRAIL) is a promising anticancer reagent for antitumor therapy.
28571773	However, many cancer cells, including malignant glioma cells, tend to be resistant to GENE_8743_TRAIL, due to repeat treat to cancer cells, highlighting the need for strategies to overcome GENE_8743_TRAIL resistance.
28571773	Here we present that in combination with CHEMICAL_C042577_diallyl_trisulfide (CHEMICAL__DATS), exposure to GENE_8743_TRAIL induced apoptosis in GENE_8743_TRAIL-resistant glioma cells.
28571773	Surprisingly, we found that subtoxic concentrations of CHEMICAL__DATS significantly potentiated GENE_8743_TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in glioma cells.
28571773	CHEMICAL__DATS dramatically upregulated GENE_8795_DR5 receptor expression but had no effects on GENE_8797_DR4 receptor.
28571773	In addition, CHEMICAL__DATS enhances GENE_8743_TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein (GENE_4170_Mcl_1) and the upregulation of GENE_8795_DR5 receptors through actions on the ROS- induced-GENE_7157_p53.
28579251	Perinatal exposure to organohalogen pollutants decreases CHEMICAL_D014667_vasopressin content and its mRNA expression in magnocellular neuroendocrine cells activated by osmotic stress in adult SPECIES_10116_rats.
28579251	CHEMICAL_D011078_Polychlorinated_biphenyls (CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs) and CHEMICAL_D055768_polybrominated_diphenyl_ethers (CHEMICAL_D055768_PBDEs) are environmental pollutants that produce DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity and DISEASE_D018358_neuroendocrine_disruption.
28579251	They affect the vasopressinergic system but their disruptive mechanisms are not well understood.
28579251	Our group reported that SPECIES_10116_rats perinatally exposed to CHEMICAL_D020111_Aroclor_1254 (CHEMICAL__A1254) and CHEMICAL_C086401_DE_71 (commercial mixtures of CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs and CHEMICAL_D055768_PBDEs) decrease somatodendritic vasopressin (CHEMICAL_D001127_AVP) release while increasing plasma AVP responses to osmotic activation, potentially emptying AVP reserves required for body-water balance.
28579251	The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of perinatal exposure to CHEMICAL__A1254 or CHEMICAL_C086401_DE_71 (30mgkg/day) on AVP transcription and protein content in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, of male and female SPECIES_10116_rats, by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
28579251	cFOS mRNA expression was evaluated in order to determine neuroendocrine cells activation due to osmotic stimulation.
28579251	Animal groups were: vehicle (control); exposed to either CHEMICAL__A1254 or CHEMICAL_C086401_DE_71; both, control and exposed, subjected to osmotic challenge.
28579251	The results confirmed a physiological increase in AVP-immunoreactivity (AVP-IR) and gene expression in response to osmotic challenge as reported elsewhere.
28579251	In contrast, the exposed groups did not show this response to osmotic activation, they showed significant reduction in AVP-IR neurons, and AVP mRNA expression as compared to the hyperosmotic controls.
28579251	cFOS mRNA expression increased in CHEMICAL__A1254 dehydrated groups, suggesting that the AVP-IR decrease was not due to a lack of the response to the osmotic activation.
28579251	Therefore, CHEMICAL__A1254 may interfere with the activation of AVP mRNA transcript levels and protein, causing a central dysfunction of vasopressinergic system.
28576736	Oral CHEMICAL_D014807_Vitamin_D Rapidly Attenuates Inflammation from Sunburn: An Interventional Study.
28576736	The diverse immunomodulatory effects of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D are increasingly being recognized.
28576736	However, the ability of oral CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D to modulate acute DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in  vivo has not been established in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28576736	In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled interventional trial, 20 healthy adults were randomized to receive either placebo or a high dose of CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 (CHEMICAL_D002762_cholecalciferol) one hour after experimental sunburn induced by an erythemogenic dose of UVR.
28576736	Compared with placebo, SPECIES_9606_participants receiving CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 (200,000 international units) demonstrated reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators GENE_7124_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (P  = 0.04) and inducible CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide synthase (P  = 0.02) in skin biopsy specimens 48 hours after experimental sunburn.
28576736	A blinded, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of SPECIES_9606_participants based on global gene expression profiles revealed that SPECIES_9606_participants with significantly higher serum CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 levels after treatment (P  = 0.007) demonstrated increased skin expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator GENE_383_arginase_1 (P  = 0.005), and a sustained reduction in skin redness (P  = 0.02), correlating with significant expression of genes related to skin barrier repair.
28576736	In contrast, SPECIES_9606_participants with lower serum CHEMICAL_D002762_vitamin_D3 levels had significant expression of proinflammatory genes.
28576736	Together the data may have broad implications for the immunotherapeutic properties of CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D in skin homeostasis, and implicate GENE_383_arginase_1 upregulation as a previously unreported mechanism by which CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D exerts anti-inflammatory effects in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28578904	Role of RAS/Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin axis activation in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury and tubulo-interstitial DISEASE_D007674_nephropathy.
28578904	Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the development and progression of DISEASE_D051436_chronic_kidney_disease (DISEASE_D051436_CKD).
28578904	Recent studies have demonstrated activation of Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin pathway by RAS in DISEASE_D051436_CKD.
28578904	However, the underlying mechanisms of RAS and Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling interaction and their contribution to the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D051436_CKD have not been fully elucidated.
28578904	Present study is designed to investigate the role of RAS/Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin axis activation in tubulo-interstitial DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis and DISEASE_D005921_glomerulosclerosis by the cultured SPECIES_9606_HK_2 and podocytes.
28578904	SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells and podocytes are treated by GENE_183_angiotensin_II (GENE_183_Ang_II).
28578904	GENE_183_Ang_II up-regulates expression of various Wnt mRNA and active GENE_1499_b_catenin protein in SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells and podocytes in the time- and dose-dependent manners.
28578904	In addition, GENE_183_Ang_II induces injury, oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and impaired GENE_4780_Nrf2 activation in SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells and podocytes.
28578904	This was accompanied by up-regulations of RAS components as well as GENE_7471_Wnt1, activated GENE_1499_b_catenin and its target proteins.
28578904	RAS/Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin axis activation results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells and injuries podocytes.
28578904	The effect of GENE_183_Ang_II is inhibited by CHEMICAL_D019808_losartan and CHEMICAL_C492448_ICG_001, a Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin inhibitor.
28578904	We further found that treatment with natural products, CHEMICAL_C543443_ergone, CHEMICAL_C526957_alisol_B_23_acetate and CHEMICAL__pachymic_acid_B inhibit extracellular matrix accumulation in SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells and attenuated podocyte injury, in part, by inhibiting GENE_183_Ang_II induced RAS/Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin axis activation.
28578904	In summary, activation of RAS/Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin axis results in podocytes and tubular epithelial cell, injury and up-regulations of oxidative, inflammatory and fibrotic pathways.
28578904	These adverse effects are ameliorated by CHEMICAL_C543443_ergone, CHEMICAL_C526957_alisol_B_23_acetate and CHEMICAL__pachymic_acid_B.
28578904	Therefore, these natural products could be considered as novel Wnt/GENE_1499_b_catenin signaling inhibitors and anti-fibrotic agents.
28583816	CHEMICAL_C018855_Tert_butylhydroquinone protects PC12  cells against CHEMICAL_C020748_ferrous_sulfate-induced oxidative and DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory injury via the GENE_10116)_Nrf2/ARE pathway.
28583816	Increasing evidence had proved the critical role of CHEMICAL_D007501_iron in the pathogenesis of numerous DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_diseases because of its capacity to promote the formation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS).
28583816	CHEMICAL_C018855_Tert_butylhydroquinone (CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ) was a metabolite of CHEMICAL_D002083_butylated_hydroxyanisole, a widely used food antioxidant.
28583816	This study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ on a cellular model of DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disease, which was established in PC12  cells by exposure to CHEMICAL_C020748_ferrous_sulfate (FS), and elucidate the potential protective mechanisms.
28583816	The results showed that FS exposure increased CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cell apoptosis in PC12  cells, accompanied by significant increases in the GENE_10116)_bax/GENE_10116)_bcl_2 ratio, cytochrome c release, and GENE_10116)_caspase_3 cleavage.
28583816	It also enhanced the ROS production, CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) content (lipid peroxidation), y-H2A.X formation (DNA damage), and promoted GENE_10116)_nuclear_factor_kappa_B (GENE_10116)_NF_kB) activation and expressions of GENE_10116)_cyclooxygenase_2 (GENE_10116)_COX_2), DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor-a (GENE_10116)_TNF_a) and GENE_10116)_interleukin_1b (GENE_10116)_IL_1b).
28583816	CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ pretreatment alleviated FS-induced LDH release, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory response by promoting GENE_10116)_Nrf2 nuclear translocation and the protein levels of GENE_10116)_Nrf2 downstream target genes GENE_10116)_heme_oxygenase_1 (GENE_10116)_Hmox_1), CHEMICAL_D009249_nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate (CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH): CHEMICAL_C004532_quinone oxidoreductase-1 (GENE_10116)_Nqo1) and GENE_10116)_glutathione_peroxidase_1 (GENE_10116)_Gpx1).
28583816	CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ alleviated the FS-induced LDH release in control siRNA-treated PC12  cells, but failed to alleviate FS-induced LDH release in GENE_10116)_Nrf2 siRNA-treated cells.
28583816	These findings suggested that pretreatment with CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ protected PC12  cells from FS-induced oxidative and DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory injury via the GENE_10116)_Nrf2/ARE pathway.
28583816	CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ was promising as a potential therapeutic agent for DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_diseases induced by DISEASE_D064420_iron_toxicity and should be encouraged for further research.
28587418	Synergistic inhibition of DISEASE_D007938_leukemia SPECIES_10090_WEHI_3 cell growth by CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide and DISEASE_D002549_Hedyotis_diffusa Willd extract in vitro and in vivo.
28587418	CHEMICAL_C006632_Arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO) is clinically used to treat DISEASE_D015473_acute_promyelocytic_leukemia (DISEASE_D015473_APL); however, the therapeutic dose of CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO may prompt critical cardiac side effects.
28587418	Combination therapy may be used to improve the therapeutic efficiency.
28587418	To evaluate this possibility, the present study determined the combined effects of DISEASE_D002549_Hedyotis_diffusa Willd (HDW) extract and CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO in leukemic SPECIES_10090_WEHI_3 cells.
28587418	The results demonstrated that co-treatment of HDW with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO resulted in a synergistic augmentation of DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity in cells at the concentration tested.
28587418	In order to investigate the potential therapeutic application for DISEASE_D007938_leukemia, the combined effects of HDW and CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO were analyzed on the SPECIES_10090_WEHI_3 cell-induced DISEASE_D007938_orthotopic_leukemia animal model in vivo.
28587418	The SPECIES_10090_WEHI_3 cells in SPECIES_10090_mice with DISEASE_D007938_leukemia were established by injecting SPECIES_10090_murine SPECIES_10090_WEHI_3 cells into BALB/c SPECIES_10090_mice, and treating them with HDW and/or combined with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO.
28587418	The results indicated that HDW alone or HDW combined with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO promoted the total survival rate of SPECIES_10090_mice with DISEASE_D007938_leukemia, and these effects are dose-dependent.
28587418	HDW alone or HDW combined with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO did not affect the body weight, decreased the spleen weight and did not affect the liver weight.
28587418	Furthermore, the results demonstrated that HDW alone or HDW combined with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO resulted in a synergistic augmentation of apoptosis in SPECIES_10090_WEHI_3 cells at the concentration tested.
28587418	In order to further reveal the detailed mechanism of this synergistic effect on apoptosis, apoptosis-related proteins were also evaluated.
28587418	The data revealed that HDW alone or HDW combined with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO induced the expression of death receptor 4 (DR4) and GENE_10090)_DR5 and the activation of poly CHEMICAL_D000244_adenosine_diphosphate ribose polymerase, GENE_10090)_caspase_3_8_and_9.
28587418	Furthermore, HDW alone or HDW combined with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO decreased the expression levels of DISEASE_D016393_B_cell_lymphoma 2, DISEASE_D016393_B_cell_lymphoma-extra large and survivin, and increased the expression levels of Bak and t-Bid.
28587418	Altogether, the results indicate that the combination of HDW with CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO may be a promising strategy used to increase the clinical efficacy of CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO in the treatment of DISEASE_D015473_APL.
28591870	Editor's Highlight: Transcriptome Profiling Reveals CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A Alternatives Activate CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen Receptor Alpha in SPECIES_9606_Human DISEASE_D001943_Breast_Cancer Cells.
28591870	Plasticizers with estrogenic activity, such as CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), have potential adverse health effects in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28591870	Due to mounting evidence of these health effects, CHEMICAL__BPA is being phased out and replaced by other CHEMICAL_22901_bisphenol variants in "CHEMICAL__BPA-free" products.
28591870	We have compared estrogenic activity of CHEMICAL__BPA with 6 CHEMICAL_22901_bisphenol analogues [CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS); CHEMICAL__bisphenol_F (CHEMICAL__BPF); CHEMICAL__bisphenol_AP (CHEMICAL__BPAP); CHEMICAL_C583074_bisphenol_AF (CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF); CHEMICAL_C517113_bisphenol_Z (CHEMICAL__BPZ); CHEMICAL_C492482_bisphenol_B (CHEMICAL__BPB)] in 3 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell lines.
28591870	Estrogenicity was assessed (10-11-10-4  M) by cell growth in an CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated cell proliferation assay, and by the induction of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen response element-mediated transcription in a luciferase assay.
28591870	CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF was the most potent CHEMICAL_22901_bisphenol, followed by CHEMICAL__BPB   >   CHEMICAL__BPZ     BPA   >   CHEMICAL__BPF_BPAP   >   CHEMICAL__BPS.
28591870	The addition of CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI_182_780 antagonized the activation of ERs.
28591870	Data mining of ToxCast high-throughput screening assays confirm our results but also show divergence in the sensitivities of the assays.
28591870	Gene expression profiles were determined in MCF-7 cells by microarray analysis.
28591870	The comparison of transcriptome profile alterations resulting from CHEMICAL__BPA alternatives with an GENE_2099_ERa gene expression biomarker further indicates that all CHEMICAL__BPA alternatives act as GENE_2099_ERa agonists in MCF-7 cells.
28591870	These results were confirmed by Illumina-based RNA sequencing.
28591870	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__BPA alternatives are not necessarily less estrogenic than CHEMICAL__BPA in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28591870	CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF, CHEMICAL__BPB, and CHEMICAL__BPZ were more estrogenic than CHEMICAL__BPA.
28591870	These findings point to the importance of better understanding the risk of adverse effects from exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA alternatives, including hormone-dependent DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28592917	Persistent Unresolved Inflammation in the<i>GENE_10090)_Mecp2</i>-308 Female Mutated SPECIES_10090_Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome.
28592917	DISEASE_D015518_Rett_syndrome (DISEASE_D015518_RTT) is a rare DISEASE_D002658_neurodevelopmental_disorder usually caused by mutations in the X-linked gene<i>CHEMICAL_32875_methyl-CHEMICAL__CpG-binding protein 2</i>(<i>GENE_4204_MECP2</i>).
28592917	Several<i>GENE_10090)_Mecp2</i>mutant SPECIES_10090_mouse lines have been developed recapitulating part of the clinical features.
28592917	In particular,<i>GENE_10090)_Mecp2</i>-308 female heterozygous SPECIES_10090_mice, bearing a truncating mutation, are a validated model of the disease.
28592917	While recent data suggest a role for DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in DISEASE_D015518_RTT, little information on the inflammatory status in SPECIES_10090_murine models of the disease is available.
28592917	Here, we investigated the inflammatory status by proteomic 2-DE/MALDI-ToF/ToF analyses in symptomatic<i>GENE_10090)_Mecp2</i>-308 female SPECIES_10090_mice.
28592917	Ten differentially expressed proteins were evidenced in the<i>GENE_4204_Mecp2</i>-308 mutated plasma proteome.
28592917	In particular, 5 positive acute-phase response (GENE_5366_APR) proteins increased (i.e., GENE_3827_kininogen_1, alpha-fetoprotein, CHEMICAL_D008358_mannose-binding protein C, GENE_5265_alpha_1_antitrypsin, and GENE_2_alpha_2_macroglobulin), and 3 negative GENE_5366_APR reactants were decreased (i.e., GENE_7018_serotransferrin, albumin, and GENE_335_apolipoprotein_A1).
28592917	CD5 antigen-like and CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D-binding protein, two proteins strictly related to DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, were also changed.
28592917	These results indicate for the first time a persistent unresolved DISEASE_D007249_inflammation of unknown origin in the<i>GENE_10090)_Mecp2</i>-308 SPECIES_10090_mouse model.
28593498	CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE-induced genotoxicity: relationship between DNA adducts, mutagenicity in the in vitro SPECIES_9823_PIG-A assay, and the transcriptional response to DNA damage in TK6 cells.
28593498	CHEMICAL_D001564_Benzo_a_pyrene is a known SPECIES_9606_human carcinogen.
28593498	As underlying mechanism, the induction of stable DNA adducts and mutations have been repeatedly demonstrated.
28593498	Also, the activation of cellular stress response on the transcriptional level has been described.
28593498	Nevertheless, the interrelationship between these different events is less well understood, especially at low, for SPECIES_9606_human exposure relevant concentrations.
28593498	Within the present study, we applied the reactive metabolite CHEMICAL_30614_benzo_a_pyrene_diolepoxide (CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE) in the nanomolar, non-cytotoxic concentration range in SPECIES_9606_human TK6 cells and quantified the induction and repair of stable DNA adducts at the N (2)-position of CHEMICAL_D006147_guanine by HPLC with fluorescence detection.
28593498	Significant levels of DNA lesions were detected even at the lowest concentration of 10  nM CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE, with a linear increase up to 50  nM.
28593498	Relative repair was similar at all damage levels, reaching about 30% after 8  h and 60% after 24  h. Mutation frequencies were quantified as DISEASE_C537277_GPI_deficient cells by the recently established in vitro SPECIES_9823_PIG-A mutagenicity assay.
28593498	Again, a linear dose-response-relationship in the before-mentioned concentration range was observed, also when plotting the number of DISEASE_C537277_GPI_deficient cells against the number of DNA adducts.
28593498	Furthermore, we explored the time- and concentration-dependent DNA damage response on the transcriptional level via a high-throughput RT-qPCR technique by quantifying the impact of CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE on the transcription of 95 genes comprising DNA damage response, DNA repair factors, oxidative stress response, cell cycle arrest, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
28593498	As expected, CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE activated DNA damage signaling, GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_3725_AP_1 dependent signaling, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis.
28593498	However, in contrast to DNA adducts and mutations, the onset of the transcriptional DNA damage response was restricted to higher concentrations, indicating that its respective activations require a certain level of DNA lesions.
28593498	Altogether, the results indicate that in case of CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE, DNA lesions and mutations were correlated at all concentrations, suggesting that repair is not complete even at low levels of DNA damage.
28593498	Considering the ongoing discussion on potential thresholds also for genotoxic carcinogens, the results are of major relevance, both with respect to basic research as well as to risk assessment of chemical carcinogens.
28589171	Microarray dataset of transient and permanent DNA methylation changes in HeLa cells undergoing inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
28589171	The novel dataset presented here represents the results of the changing pattern of DNA methylation profiles in HeLa cells exposed to chronic low dose (0.5    M) CHEMICAL_C017947_sodium_arsenite, resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well as DNA methylation patterns in cells where inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic has been removed.
28589171	Inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic is a known carcinogen, though not mutagenic.
28589171	Several mechanisms have been proposed as to how inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic drives carcinogenesis such as regulation of the cell* s redox potential and/or epigenetics.
28589171	In fact, there are gene specific studies and limited genome-wide studies that have implicated epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation in inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
28589171	However, genome-wide studies about the impact of 1) chronic, low-dose inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure on DNA methylation patterns during inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and 2) the removal inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic (reversal) on DNA methylation patterns, is lacking.
28589171	For this dataset, two replicates were performed with each of the samples - non-treated, inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-treated, and reverse-treated cells.
28589171	We provide normalized and processed data, and log2 fold change in DNA methylation.
28589171	The raw microarray data are available through NCBI GEO, accession number GSE95232 and a related research paper has been accepted for published in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (Eckstein et al., 2017) [1].
28595002	CHEMICAL_D003931_Diacetyl/CHEMICAL_17399_l_Xylulose Reductase Mediates Chemical Redox Cycling in Lung Epithelial Cells.
28595002	Reactive CHEMICAL__carbonyls such as CHEMICAL__diacetyl_2_3_butanedione_ and CHEMICAL_C013186_2_3_pentanedione in SPECIES_4097_tobacco and many food and consumer products are known to cause severe DISEASE_D012131_respiratory_diseases.
28595002	Many of these chemicals are detoxified by CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl reductases in the lung, in particular, CHEMICAL__dicarbonyl_l_xylulose reductase (GENE_51181_DCXR), a multifunctional enzyme important in CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose metabolism.
28595002	GENE_51181_DCXR is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily.
28595002	Using recombinant SPECIES_9606_human enzyme, we discovered that GENE_51181_DCXR mediates redox cycling of a variety of CHEMICAL_D011809_quinones generating CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide anion, CHEMICAL_D006861_hydrogen_peroxide, and, in the presence of CHEMICAL_27081_transition_metals, CHEMICAL_D017665_hydroxyl radicals.
28595002	Redox cycling activity preferentially utilized CHEMICAL_D009243_NADH as a cosubstrate and was greatest for CHEMICAL_C005399_9_10_phenanthrenequinone and CHEMICAL_C040756_1_2_naphthoquinone, followed by CHEMICAL_C035342_1_4_naphthoquinone and CHEMICAL_D024483_2_methyl_1_4_naphthoquinone (CHEMICAL_D024483_menadione).
28595002	Using CHEMICAL_C005399_9_10_phenanthrenequinone as the substrate, CHEMICAL_C004532_quinone redox cycling was found to inhibit GENE_51181_DCXR reduction of CHEMICAL_17399_l_xylulose and CHEMICAL_D003931_diacetyl.
28595002	Competitive inhibition of enzyme activity by the CHEMICAL_C004532_quinone was observed with respect to CHEMICAL_D003931_diacetyl (Ki = 190  M) and CHEMICAL_17399_l_xylulose (Ki = 940  M).
28595002	Abundant GENE_51181_DCXR activity was identified in A549 lung epithelial cells when CHEMICAL_D003931_diacetyl was used as a substrate.
28595002	CHEMICAL_D011809_Quinones inhibited reduction of this CHEMICAL__dicarbonyl, causing an accumulation of CHEMICAL_D003931_diacetyl in the cells and culture medium and a decrease in CHEMICAL_D000093_acetoin, the reduced product of CHEMICAL_D003931_diacetyl.
28595002	The identification of GENE_51181_DCXR as an enzyme activity mediating chemical redox cycling suggests that it may be important in generating cytotoxic reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species in the lung.
28595002	These activities, together with the inhibition of CHEMICAL__dicarbonyl/CHEMICAL_17399_l_xylulose metabolism by redox-active chemicals, as well as consequent deficiencies in CHEMICAL_25901_pentose metabolism, are likely to contribute to DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury following exposure to CHEMICAL__dicarbonyls and CHEMICAL_D011809_quinones.
28595958	Olive CHEMICAL__phenolic compounds attenuate CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_and_kidney_toxicity through regulating oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis.
28595958	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of ethanolic olive fruit extract (OFE) and its CHEMICAL__phenolic compound, CHEMICAL_C002769_oleuropein (CHEMICAL_25667_OLE), against DISEASE_D007674_hepato_renal_toxicity induced by CHEMICAL_C017180_deltamethrin (CHEMICAL__DEM), a synthetic CHEMICAL__pyrethroid, in Wistar rats.
28595958	The kidney and liver tissues were collected after 30 days of treatment for subsequent investigation.
28595958	Rats that were given CHEMICAL__DEM had a highly significant elevation in the serum biomarkers as well as hepatic and renal levels of lipid peroxidation (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA).
28595958	Additionally, a significant reduction in the total antioxidant capacity (CHEMICAL_C002502_ABTS_), CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities was noted.
28595958	This toxic effect was confirmed by histological studies and the expression levels of inflammatory (cox-2) and apoptotic genes (bcl-2 and p53).
28595958	The findings for the OFE and OLEtreated groups highlighted the efficacy of olive fruit CHEMICAL__phenolic compounds as hepatic and renal-protectant in CHEMICAL__DEM-induced hepato-renal toxicity through improving the oxidative status as well as suppressing DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis.
28595958	Therefore, they may be used as protective natural compounds against CHEMICAL__DEM-induced hepato-renal toxicity.
28595984	Cell cycle pathway dysregulation in SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes during chronic exposure to low CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28595984	BACKGROUND: CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic is naturally prevalent in the earth's crust and widely distributed in air and water.
28595984	Chronic low CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure is associated with several DISEASE_D009369_cancers in vivo, including DISEASE_D012878_skin_cancer, and with transformation in vitro of cell lines including immortalized SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes (HaCaT).
28595984	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic also is associated with cell cycle dysregulation at different exposure levels in multiple cell lines.
28595984	In this work, we analyzed gene expression in HaCaT cells to gain an understanding of gene expression changes contributing to transformation at an early time point.
28595984	METHODS: HaCaT cells were exposed to 0 or 100nM CHEMICAL_29678_NaAsO2 for 7weeks.
28595984	Total RNA was purified and analyzed by microarray hybridization.
28595984	Differential expression with fold change>=  1.5  and p-value<= 0.05 was determined using Partek Genomic Suite    and pathway and network analyses using MetaCore    software (FDR<= 0.05).
28595984	Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry.
28595984	RESULTS: 644 mRNAs were differentially expressed.
28595984	Cell cycle/cell cycle regulation pathways predominated in the list of dysregulated pathways.
28595984	Genes involved in replication origin licensing were enriched in the network.
28595984	Cell cycle assay analysis showed an increase in G2/M compartment in CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-exposed cells.
28595984	CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICAL_C015001_Arsenite exposure induced differential gene expression indicating dysregulation of cell cycle control, which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis.
28595984	The results suggest that cell cycle dysregulation is an early event in transformation manifested in cells unable to transit G2/M efficiently.
28595984	Further study at later time points will reveal additional changes in gene expression related to transformation processes.
28595985	CHEMICAL_D003474_Curcumin inhibits adipogenesis induced by CHEMICAL_C027561_benzyl_butyl_phthalate in 3T3-L1 cells.
28595985	CHEMICAL_26092_Phthalates are a group of endocrine disrupting chemicals and may have contributed to the recent global DISEASE_D009765_obesity health crisis.
28595985	Increased adipogenesis via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (PPARy)-CCAAT-enhancer binding protein a (GENE_10090)_C_EBPa) pathway could be one critical mechanism responsible for CHEMICAL_C032279_phthalate-induced DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain.
28595985	On the other hand, CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis in cells and animal models.
28595985	The present study was undertaken to evaluate, for the first time, whether CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin could reduce adipogenesis induced by CHEMICAL_C027561_benzyl_butyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_C408472_BBP) via downregulation of the PPARy-GENE_10090)_C_EBPa pathway.
28595985	3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated by treating them with insulin, CHEMICAL_D003907_dexamethasone, and CHEMICAL_D015056_3_isobutyl_1_methylxanthine in the presence of CHEMICAL_C408472_BBP, with or without CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin.
28595985	Cells that were grown in the presence of CHEMICAL_C408472_BBP alone showed a significant increase in CHEMICAL_D014280_triacylglycerol (TG) levels.
28595985	In addition, the number of CHEMICAL_C011049_Oil_Red_O-stained cells and the mRNA expression levels of PPARy, GENE_10090)_C_EBPa, GENE_10090)_adiponectin, and GENE_10090)_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_10090)_TNFa) were significantly increased.
28595985	However, treatment with CHEMICAL_C408472_BBP in combination with CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin resulted in major reductions in TG levels, the numbers of Oil Red O-stained cells, and the mRNA expression levels of the four proteins.
28595985	These results suggest that CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin might be an inhibitor of CHEMICAL_C408472_BBP-induced DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation via stimulation of adipocyte differentiation and GENE_10090)_TNFa generation.
28595985	CHEMICAL_D003474_Curcumin may, therefore, be a potential medication for preventing the harmful effects of CHEMICAL_26092_phthalates.
28597291	Multiple drug transporters mediate the placental transport of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride.
28597291	CHEMICAL_D013469_Sulpiride is a typical antipsychotic drug for the treatment of DISEASE_D012559_schizophrenia, DISEASE_D003866_depression and other DISEASE_D030342_psychological_disorders.
28597291	It has been proven that a small amount of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride could cross the SPECIES_9606_human placenta  using an  ex vivo  placental perfusion model.
28597291	However, the placental transfer mechanism has not been elucidated.
28597291	Considering the structure of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride, we speculated that the transporters expressed in placenta might be involved in CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride uptake across the blood-placenta barrier.
28597291	The aim of our study was to determine which transporters contributed to the placental transfer of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride.
28597291	Our results revealed that CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride was a substrate of SPECIES_9606_human organic cation transporter (hOCT) 3, SPECIES_9606_human multidrug resistance protein (hMDR) 1 and SPECIES_9606_human GENE_9429_breast_cancer_resistance_protein (GENE_9429_hBCRP) using transfected cells expressing respective transporters.
28597291	In addition, the accumulation of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride in BeWo cells (a SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D002822_choriocarcinoma cell line) was obviously affected by inhibitors of GENE_6584_carnitine_organic_cation_transporter_OCTN_2, GENE_5243_MDR1 and GENE_9429_BCRP.
28597291	The accumulation of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride in primary SPECIES_9606_human trophoblast cells was obviously affected by inhibitors of GENE_6581_OCT3, GENE_6583_OCTN1 and GENE_6584_OCTN2.
28597291	The above results indicate that GENE_6583_hOCTN1 and GENE_6584_hOCTN2 likely contribute to the CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride uptake from maternal circulation to trophoblast cells, while GENE_5243_hMDR1 and GENE_9429_hBCRP mediate the efflux from trophoblast cells to maternal circulation, and GENE_6581_hOCT3 probably is involved in the bidirectional transport of CHEMICAL_D013469_sulpiride between the placenta and fetal blood.
28596144	Serum protein expression profiling and bioinformatics analysis in workers occupationally exposed to CHEMICAL_C074702_chromium_VI_.
28596144	CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ is widely-recognized as occupational and environmental contaminant, but the precise underlying mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ induced DISEASE_D064420_carcinogenic_toxicity remain to be elucidated.
28596144	Among kinds of toxic mechanisms, alteration of protein profiling usually elaborate a key mechanism of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28596144	Large-scale proteins changes can reflect the onset or progression of DISEASE_D064420_carcinogenic_toxicity, and potential serum protein biomarkers of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ exposure.
28596144	To gain an insight into the serum proteins expression profiling in chromate workers and find potential novel serum proteins biomarkers of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ exposure, 107 male SPECIES_9606_participants from a chromate production plant were recruited into the study.
28596144	Questionnaire was applied to collect personal information and occupational history.
28596144	CHEMICAL_D002857_Chromium concentration in blood (CrB) was measured to evaluate the SPECIES_9606_participants' internal exposure.
28596144	Serum proteins profiling and bioinformatics analysis were performed to explore differentially expressed proteins, proteins-chemical interaction network, critical proteins nodes related to the signaling pathways among 16 controls and 25 exposure workers in the first stage.
28596144	ELISA tests were applied to verify the critical interested proteins nodes in the remaining 41 exposure workers and 25 controls.
28596144	The results showed that the CrB levels in the control group were significantly lower than that in the exposure group (P<0.05).
28596144	44 significantly differentially expressed serum proteins formed 16 significant signaling pathways and a complex proteins-chemical interaction network, which associated with the immune system and extracellular matrix organization.
28596144	GENE_1401_C_reactive_protein (GENE_1401_CRP), GENE_6469_sonic_hedgehog_protein (GENE_6469_SHH) and CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium located at critical nodes in proteins-chemical interaction network.
28596144	There was a significant negative correlation between serum GENE_1401_CRP level and CrB (P<0.05), and a significant positive correlation between GENE_6469_SHH concentrations and CrB (P<0.05), which indicated that GENE_1401;6469_CRP_and_SHH might be as the potential novel biomarkers of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ exposure.
28596144	Also, the current study preliminarily paved the way to further functional studies to understand the underlying mechanisms and novel serum biomarkers of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ exposure.
28600122	Oxidative stress plays a key role in CHEMICAL_D002087_butyrate-mediated autophagy via GENE_207_Akt/GENE_2475_mTOR pathway in DISEASE_D006528_hepatoma cells.
28600122	DISEASE_D006528_Hepatocellular_Carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC) is one of the most DISEASE_D009369_aggressive_forms_of_cancer, responsible for a number of deaths in SPECIES_9606_humans.
28600122	CHEMICAL_D002087_Butyrate, one of the short chain CHEMICAL_D005227_fatty_acids produced by the gut microbiota during anaerobic fermentation, was shown to be beneficial for inhibiting DISEASE_D009369_cancer growth.
28600122	In this study, we showed that CHEMICAL_D020148_sodium_butyrate induced autophagy via reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) in DISEASE_D006528_hepatoma cells.
28600122	CHEMICAL_D002087_Butyrate (0-6  mM) incubation significantly increased intracellular ROS levels (45.2% compared to control), which in turn inhibited phosphorylation of GENE_207_akt and GENE_2475_mTOR, leading to the upregulation of autophagic proteins, such as GENE_8678_beclin_1, GENE_9474_ATG_5, LC3-II, followed by the increased autophagosome formation (34.4% compared to control cells).
28600122	Addition of a known antioxidant, CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_cysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC), reversed these CHEMICAL_D002087_butyrate-induced ROS and autophagy.
28600122	It was also found that CHEMICAL_D002087_butyrate-induced ROS enhanced MAPK activation, which was inhibited by CHEMICAL__NAC.
28600122	In conclusion, our data showed that CHEMICAL_D002087_butyrate induced ROS, which in turn induced autophagy via inhibition of GENE_207_akt/GENE_2475_mTOR pathway.
28600122	Hence, CHEMICAL_D002087_butyrate could be considered as a potential candidate for DISEASE_D006528_HCC treatment.
28601556	CHEMICAL_D002185_Cannabidiol upregulates melanogenesis through GENE_1268_CB1 dependent pathway by activating p38 MAPK and GENE_23552_p42/44 MAPK.
28601556	Melanogenesis plays a critical role in the protection of skin against external stresses such as ultraviolet irradiation and oxidative stressors.
28601556	This study was aimed to investigate the effects of CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in SPECIES_9606_human epidermal melanocytes.
28601556	We found that CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol increased both melanin content and GENE_7299_tyrosinase activity.
28601556	The mRNA levels of DISEASE_D008850_microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (GENE_4286_MITF), GENE_7299_tyrosinase, GENE_7306_tyrosinase_related_protein_TRP_1, and GENE_1638_TRP2 were increased following CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol treatment.
28601556	Likewise, CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol increased the protein levels of GENE_4286_MITF, GENE_7306_TRP_1, GENE_1638_TRP_2, and GENE_7299_tyrosinase.
28601556	Mechanistically, we found that CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol regulated melanogenesis by upregulating GENE_4286_MITF through phosphorylation of GENE_1432_p38_mitogen_activated_protein_kinase (MAPK) and GENE_23552_p42/44 MAPK, independent of CHEMICAL__cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate (CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling.
28601556	In addition, the melanogenic effect of CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol was found to be mediated by cannabinoid GENE_1268_CB1 receptor, not by CB2 receptor.
28601556	Taken together, these findings indicate that CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol-induced melanogenesis is cannabinoid GENE_1268_CB1 receptor-dependent, and CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol induces melanogenesis through increasing GENE_4286_MITF gene expression which is mediated by activation of p38 MAPK and GENE_23552_p42/44 MAPK.
28601556	Our results suggest that CHEMICAL_D002185_cannabidiol might be useful as a protective agent against external stresses.
28606764	Transcriptional profiling of male F344 SPECIES_10116_rats suggests the involvement of CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium signaling in the mode of action of CHEMICAL_D020106_acrylamide-induced DISEASE_D013964_thyroid_cancer.
28606764	CHEMICAL_D020106_Acrylamide (AA) exposure in 2-year cancer bioassays leads to thyroid, but not liver, DISEASE_D000236_adenomas and DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinomas in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28606764	Hypothesized modes of action (MOAs) include genotoxicity/mutagenicity, or DISEASE_D013959_thyroid_hormone_dysregulation.
28606764	To examine the plausibility of these two or any alternative MOAs, RNA-sequencing was performed on the thyroids and livers of AA-exposed SPECIES_10116_rats, in parallel with measurement of genotoxicity (blood micronucleus and SPECIES_9823_Pig-a mutant frequency) and serum CHEMICAL_60311_thyroid_hormone levels, following the exposure of male Fischer 344/DuCrl SPECIES_10116_rats to 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg AA/kg bw-day in drinking water for 5, 15, or 31 days.
28606764	Differentially expressed genes in both tissues provided marginal support for hormonal and genotoxic MOAs, which was consistent with negative/equivocal genotoxicity assay and marginal changes in thyroid hormone levels.
28606764	Instead, there was a pronounced effect on CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium signaling/cytoskeletal genes in the thyroid.
28606764	Benchmark dose modeling of RNA-sequencing data for the CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium signaling pathway suggests a point of departure (POD) of 0.68 mg/kg bw-day, which is consistent with a POD of 0.82 mg/kg bw-day derived from the thyroid 2-year cancer bioassay data.
28606764	Overall, this study suggests a novel MOA for AA-induced DISEASE_D013959_thyroid_carcinogenicity in male SPECIES_10116_rats centered around perturbation of CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium signaling.
28608598	Purification and partial characterization of an anticoagulant PLA2 from the venom of Indian Daboia russelii that induces inflammation through upregulation of proinflammatory mediators.
28608598	The present study describes the purification and partial characterization of a basic anticoagulant PLA2 enzyme named as Rv(i) PLA2 from the venom of Indian Daboia russelii.
28608598	The molecular mass of the protein was found to be 13,659.65  Da, and peptide mass fingerprinting revealed that it belongs to group II PLA2 family.
28608598	The peptide sequence showed similarity to uncharacterized basic PLA2 enzyme having an accession no.
28608598	of CHEMICAL__P86368 reported from Sri Lankan D. russelii.
28608598	Rv(i) PLA2 exhibited strong phospholipase A2 and anticoagulant activity.
28608598	It also induced expression of COX-2 and TNF-a mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in CHEMICAL_37537_phorbol_12_myristate_13_acetate differentiated THP-1 cells, which play a crucial role during inflammation.
28608598	Chemical modification of His residue in Rv(i) PLA2 with CHEMICAL_C006821_p_bromophenacyl_bromide abolished the enzymatic, anticoagulant, and inflammatory activities.
28608598	The result indicates that the catalytic site of Rv(i) PLA2 might play a vital role in inducing inflammation at the bite site during D. russelii envenomation.
28606428	Cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory effects of sol-gel combustion based CHEMICAL_C009495_titanium_dioxide (CHEMICAL__TiO_sub_2_sub_) particles of large surface area on RAW 264.7 macrophages.
28606428	The current study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory effects of sol-gel combustion based CHEMICAL__TiO<sub>2</sub>particles (CHEMICAL_D005998_glycine and CHEMICAL_D000409_l_alanine as reducing agents) of large surface area on RAW 264.7 macrophages.
28606428	RAW 264.7 macrophages exposed to varying concentrations of CHEMICAL__TiO_sub_2_sub_particles (0.001 to 1000 g/ml) were assessed after 24h and showed a reduced cell viability at 100 and 1000 g/ml and increased LDH release at 10 g/ml.
28606428	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__TiO<sub>2</sub>particles (0.1, 1 and 10 g/ml) were utilized to assess the immune responses and intracellular ROS levels on RAW 264.7 macrophages.
28606428	CHEMICAL__TiO<sub>2</sub>particles at 10 g/ml showed increased mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, GENE_3553_IL_1b and GENE_3569_IL_6), inflammatory mediators (GENE_51477_iNOS and GENE_4513_COX_2) and transcription factor (NFkB) similar to that of LPS stimulated macrophages.
28606428	However, the mRNA expression levels were found near normal levels at lower concentrations (0.1 and 1 g/ml).
28606428	In addition, CHEMICAL__TiO<sub>2</sub>particles at 10 g/ml also increased the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, GENE_3553_IL_1b and GENE_3569_IL_6) and intracellular ROS levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages similar to that of LPS stimulated macrophages.
28606428	Conclusively, CHEMICAL__TiO<sub>2</sub>particles prepared through this method at a concentration<= 0.1 g/ml can be used for various biological applications with minimal immunomodulatory effects.
28606469	Potential chemoprotective role of CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol against CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin induced DISEASE_D009422_testicular_damage in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28606469	Semen banking is often advised to male SPECIES_9606_patients undergoing chemotherapy as the damage induced is profound and often irreversible.
28606469	However, low success rates of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) using banked semen have led to the quest for alternative methods to treat chemotherapy-induced DISEASE_D007246_infertility.
28606469	The present study therefore aimed to study the role of CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol against CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin induced DISEASE_D009422_testicular_damage.
28606469	Male albino SPECIES_10090_mice were divided into five groups (n  =  6 each), viz.
28606469	normal control, CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol vehicle (4% CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol), CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin (7.5  mg/kg b.wt/week for 4 weeks), CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol (1  mg/kg b.wt./orally for 28 days) and CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol and CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin combination group.
28606469	CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin treatment led to an increase in the activity of CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase and an increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation.
28606469	CHEMICAL_D005978_Glutathione levels were found to decrease with a concomitant increase in the levels of CHEMICAL_D019803_oxidized_glutathione and altered status of antioxidant enzymes.
28606469	Increased DNA fragmentation was also evident which was further confirmed by histopathological and FT-IR analysis.
28606469	CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol treatment in combination with CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin showed great promise in bringing down the damage statistics to near normal values in most of the parameters studied.
28606469	Further studies in this direction are however needed to develop an alternative to current procedures adopted to treat chemotherapy-induced DISEASE_D007248_male_infertility.
28615018	The aquaglyceroporin GENE_366_AQP9 contributes to the sex-specific effects of in utero CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure on placental gene expression.
28615018	BACKGROUND: Sex-specific factors play a major role in SPECIES_9606_human health and disease, including responses to environmental stresses such as toxicant exposure.
28615018	Increasing evidence suggests that such sex differences also exist during fetal development.
28615018	In a previous report using the resources of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS), we found that low-to-moderate in utero exposure to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic, a highly toxic and widespread pollutant, was associated with altered expression of several key developmental genes in the fetal portion of the placenta.
28615018	These associations were sex-dependent, suggesting that in utero CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure differentially impacts male and female fetuses.
28615018	In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis for these sex-specific responses to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic.
28615018	METHODS: Using NanoString technology, we further analyzed the fetal placenta samples from the NHBCS for the expression of genes encoding CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic transporters and metabolic enzymes.
28615018	Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine their relationship with CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure and with key developmental genes, after stratification by fetal sex.
28615018	RESULTS: We found that maternal CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure was strongly associated with expression of the GENE_366_AQP9 gene, encoding an aquaglyceroporin transporter, in female but not male fetal placenta.
28615018	Moreover, GENE_366_AQP9 expression associated with that of a subset of female-specific CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-responsive genes.
28615018	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that GENE_366_AQP9 is upregulated in response to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure in female, but not male, fetal placenta.
28615018	Based on these results and prior studies, increased GENE_366_AQP9 expression may lead to increased CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic transport in the female fetal placenta, which in turn may alter the expression patterns of key developmental genes that we have previously shown to be associated with CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure.
28615018	Thus, this study suggests that GENE_366_AQP9 may play a role in the sex-specific effects of in utero CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure.
28613393	Comparison of the toxicity of the dyes CHEMICAL_C033003_Sudan_II and CHEMICAL_C009213_Sudan_IV to catalase.
28613393	The mechanisms of the toxicity of CHEMICAL__Sudan dyes to the key antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) were investigated by spectroscopic methods, calorimetry techniques, enzyme activity assay, and molecular docking.
28613393	Results showed that CHEMICAL__Sudan dyes bound to CAT through hydrophobic force, which changed the microenvironment of CHEMICAL_D014364_tryptophan and CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine residues, leading to a conformational alteration and shrinkage of the protein.
28613393	Enzyme activity assay and molecular docking revealed that the activity of CAT was slightly inhibited in the presence of CHEMICAL__Sudan dyes.
28613393	In comparison, the binding of CHEMICAL_C033003_Sudan_II with CAT was slightly stronger than CHEMICAL_C009213_Sudan_IV.
28613393	Also, CHEMICAL_C033003_Sudan_II and CHEMICAL_C009213_Sudan_IV showed a different impact on the microenvironment of CHEMICAL_33856_aromatic_amino_acid residues.
28613393	But the dyes had very similar effects on conformation and activity of the protein.
28613393	This work provides an essential reference for the evaluation of CHEMICAL__Sudan_dyes' effects on body's antioxidant defense system and safe use of CHEMICAL__Sudan dyes.
28619387	Evaluation of ameliorative ability of CHEMICAL_C440975_Silibinin against CHEMICAL_D015215_zidovudine and CHEMICAL_D007538_isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity and hyperlipidaemia in SPECIES_10116_rats: Role of CHEMICAL_C440975_Silibinin in Phase I and II drug metabolism.
28619387	SPECIES_11709_HIV/DISEASE_D000163_AIDS SPECIES_9606_patients have suppressed immune system, making them vulnerable to many DISEASE_D009894_opportunistic_infections including DISEASE_D014376_tuberculosis (DISEASE_D014376_TB).
28619387	The SPECIES_9606_patients who are co-infected with DISEASE_D014376_TB undergo combined regimens with anti-retroviral drugs such as CHEMICAL_D015215_zidovudine (CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT) and anti-tubercular drug such as CHEMICAL_D007538_isoniazid (CHEMICAL__INH) for therapy leading to hepatotoxicty.
28619387	CHEMICAL_C440975_Silibinin (CHEMICAL_30304_SBN), extracted from SPECIES_92921_Silybum_marianum commonly called as "SPECIES_92921_Milk_thistle" is used against several drugs-induced hepatotoxicity.
28619387	The present study evaluates the ameliorative effect of CHEMICAL_30304_SBN against CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT alone, CHEMICAL__INH alone, and CHEMICAL__INH  +  CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT-induced toxic insults to liver of SPECIES_10116_rats.
28619387	Wistar albino SPECIES_10116_rats (n  =  6/groups) were given CHEMICAL__INH and CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT (25 and 50  mg  mg/kg b.w.)
28619387	respectively either alone or in combination for a sub-chronic period of 45 days orally.
28619387	Another group of SPECIES_10116_rats received CHEMICAL_30304_SBN (100  mg/kg b.w.)
28619387	along with CHEMICAL__INH and CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT.
28619387	The group that received CHEMICAL_D019946_propylene_glycol served as control.
28619387	CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT alone, CHEMICAL__INH alone and CHEMICAL__INH  +  CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT treatments showed DISEASE_D009081_parenchymal_cell_injury and DISEASE_D002779_cholestasis by highly significant increase in the activities of marker enzymes (CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate and CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, argino CHEMICAL_D019802_succinic_acid lyase), CHEMICAL_D001663_bilirubin and protein.
28619387	The presence of hyperlipidaemia was observed by analyzing lipid profiles in serum/liver/adipose tissue, gene expression (RT-PCR) of Phase-I and II metabolizing enzymes and western blot.
28619387	Transmission electron microscopy study also revealed large vacuoles with membraneous debri, pleomorphic mitochondria, disruption of endoplasmic reticulum, presence of lipid droplets, breakage in cellular and nuclear membrane.
28619387	CHEMICAL_30304_SBN simultaneous treatment showed ameliorative effect against CHEMICAL__INH  +  CHEMICAL_D015215_AZT-induced hepatotoxicity and DISEASE_D006949_hyperlipidemia in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28619521	Overview of long non-coding RNA and mRNA expression in response to CHEMICAL_D008694_methamphetamine treatment in vitro.
28619521	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) display multiple functions including regulation of DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_injury.
28619521	However, their impact in CHEMICAL_D008694_methamphetamine (CHEMICAL_D008694_METH)-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity has rarely been reported.
28619521	Here, using microarray analysis, we investigated the expression profiling of lncRNAs and mRNAs in primary cultured prefrontal cortical neurons after CHEMICAL_D008694_METH treatment.
28619521	We observed a difference in lncRNA and mRNA expression between the experimental and sham control groups.
28619521	Using bioinformatics, we analyzed the highest enriched gene ontology (GO) terms of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and pathway network analysis.
28619521	Furthermore, an lncRNA-mRNA co-expression sub-network for aberrantly expressed terms revealed possible interactions of lncRNA NR_110713 and NR_027943 with their related genes.
28619521	Afterwards, three lncRNAs (NR_110713, NR_027943, GENE_60674_GAS5) and two mRNAs (GENE_1649_Ddit3, GENE_100506742_Casp12) were targeted to validate the microarray data by qRT-PCR.
28619521	This presented an overview of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiling and indicated that lncRNA might participate in CHEMICAL_D008694_METH-induced DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_apoptosis by regulating the coding genes of neurons.
28619522	Integrated analysis of CHEMICAL_D010269_paraquat-induced microRNAs-mRNAs changes in SPECIES_9606_human neural progenitor cells.
28619522	CHEMICAL_D010269_Paraquat (PQ), one of the most widely used fast-acting and non-selective herbicides in the world is believed to act as a neurotoxicant, which increases the risk of developing DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD) by selectively impairing dopaminergic neurons.
28619522	However, the mechanism of PQ on neural progenitor cells remains unclear.
28619522	As regulator of mRNA expression, miRNA play a crucial role in DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28619522	Based on our previous study, we chose 10 M PQ, which induced ROS production and inhibited proliferation but not reduced the cell viability.
28619522	In this study, we present an integrative analysis of PQ-induced whole transcriptome changes and its regulatory miRNA networks in SPECIES_9606_human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs).
28619522	Integrated analysis of PQ-induced miRNA-mRNA alteration reveals differential expression of 3972 mRNAs and 52 miRNAs.
28619522	Based on the GO analysis and pathway analysis of the intersection genes, we found 48 significantly altered GO terms and 22 significant pathways, among which, Wnt signaling being the top-ranked pathway.
28619522	We verified that the expression of 9 miRNAs and 11 mRNAs related to the Wnt signaling pathway were altered in a dose-dependent manner by qPCR.
28619522	These results indicate that PQ changes mRNAs and miRNAs expression in hNPCs, leading to the alteration of several neurodevelopment related key biological processes and crucial pathways, especially Wnt signaling pathway.
28619522	Moreover, it suggests that PQ could downregulate Wnt signaling pathway via miRNA to induce developmental DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28619389	The promising effect of CHEMICAL_C568794_linagliptin and/or CHEMICAL_C016517_indole_3_carbinol on experimentally-induced DISEASE_D011085_polycystic_ovarian_syndrome.
28619389	DISEASE_D011085_Polycystic_ovarian_syndrome (DISEASE_D011085_PCOS) is one of the most common medical conditions that lead to DISEASE_D007247_female_infertility worldwide.
28619389	The aim of this study was to assess the effect of CHEMICAL_C568794_linagliptin and/or CHEMICAL_C016517_indole_3_carbinol (CHEMICAL__I3C) on DISEASE_D011085_PCOS in female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28619389	Fifty female SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were randomly allocated into five equal groups: Control group; CHEMICAL_C067431_Letrozole-induced DISEASE_D011085_PCOS group; CHEMICAL_C067431_Letrozole  +  CHEMICAL_C568794_Linagliptin group; CHEMICAL_C067431_Letrozole  +  CHEMICAL__I3C group and CHEMICAL_C067431_Letrozole  +  CHEMICAL_C568794_Linagliptin  +  CHEMICAL__I3C group.
28619389	Body weight, body mass index, Lee index and ovarian indices were determined.
28619389	Plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), free CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol, CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone, prolactin, fasting DISEASE_D018149_blood_glucose (FBG) and fasting plasma insulin were measured.
28619389	Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) was calculated.
28619389	Tissue antioxidant status, GENE_10116)_transforming_growth_factor_beta_1 (GENE_10116)_TGF_b1), DISEASE_D009369_tumor necrosis factor alpha (GENE_10116)_TNF_a), GENE_10116)_interleukin_10 (GENE_10116)_IL_10) and GENE_10116)_Nrf2/GENE_10116)_HO_1 content were assessed.
28619389	Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the ovaries were done.
28619389	CHEMICAL_C568794_Linagliptin and/or CHEMICAL__I3C induced significant decrease in tissue GENE_10116)_TGF_b1, GENE_10116)_TNF_a, GENE_10116)_IL_10, plasma free CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone, luteinizing hormone, CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone, CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol, FBG and insulin levels associated with significant improvement of insulin resistance whereas tissue GENE_10116)_Nrf2/GENE_10116)_HO_1 content and antioxidant enzymes were significantly increased compared to DISEASE_D011085_PCOS group.
28619389	In addition, final body weight, final body mass and Lee indices were significantly decreased compared to DISEASE_D011085_PCOS group.
28619389	Also, there was significant improvement of the ovarian morphology compared to DISEASE_D011085_PCOS group.
28619389	This improvement was significant with CHEMICAL_C568794_linagliptin/CHEMICAL__I3C combination compared to the use of each of these drugs alone.
28619389	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_C568794_linagliptin/CHEMICAL__I3C combination might represent a beneficial therapeutic modality for amelioration of DISEASE_D011085_PCOS.
28624442	DISEASE_D034381_Loss_of_fructose_1,6-bisphosphatase induces glycolysis and promotes apoptosis resistance of DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem-like cells: an important role in CHEMICAL_C074702_hexavalent_chromium-induced DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28624442	CHEMICAL_C074702_Hexavalent_chromium (CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_) compounds are confirmed SPECIES_9606_human carcinogens for DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer.
28624442	Our previous studies has demonstrated that chronic exposure of SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to low dose of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_ causes malignant cell transformation.
28624442	The acquisition of DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem cell-like properties is involved in the DISEASE_D009369_initiation_of_cancers.
28624442	The present study has observed that a small population of DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem-like cells (BEAS-2B-Cr-CSC) exists in the CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_-transformed cells (BEAS-2B-Cr).
28624442	Those BEAS-2B-Cr-CSC exhibit extremely reduced capability of generating reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis resistance.
28624442	BEAS-2B-Cr-CSC are metabolic inactive as evidenced by reductions in CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen consumption, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake, CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production, and CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate production.
28624442	Most importantly, BEAS-2B-Cr-CSC are more tumorigenic with high levels of cell self-renewal genes, GENE_4851_Notch1 and GENE_644914_p21.
28624442	Further study has found that CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (GENE_2203_FBP1), an rate-limiting enzyme driving glyconeogenesis, was lost in BEAS-2B-Cr-CSC.
28624442	Forced expression of GENE_2203_FBP1 in BEAS-2B-Cr-CSC restored ROS generation, resulting in increased apoptosis, leading to inhibition of tumorigenesis.
28624442	In summary, the present study suggests that loss of GENE_2203_FBP1 is a critical event in tumorigenesis of CHEMICAL_C074702_Cr_VI_-transformed cells.
28624443	Inhibitory effect of CHEMICAL_10357_trans_caryophyllene (TC) on leukocyte-endothelial attachment.
28624443	CHEMICAL_10357_trans_Caryophyllene (TC) is a major component found in the essential oils of many spices and foods/medicinal plants.
28624443	It is a natural CHEMICAL_35189_sesquiterpene and has been the subject of numerous studies.
28624443	However, the effects of TC on DISEASE_D007249_vascular_inflammation remain unknown.
28624443	In this study, we reported that TC treatment in SPECIES_9606_human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) prevented DISEASE_D007938_attachment_of_monocytic_leukemia cell line THP-1 cells to endothelial cells.
28624443	In addition, in vivo results indicate that TC inhibited macrophage infiltration to the aortic surface and reduced total serum levels of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol and CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides.
28624443	Importantly, administration of TC could inhibit the induction of GENE_7412_vascular_cell_adhesion_molecule_1 (GENE_7412_VCAM_1) both in vitro and in vivo.
28624443	Notably, our data indicate that the inhibitory effects of TC on the expression of GENE_7412_VCAM_1 are mediated by the GENE_3717_JAK2/GENE_6772_STAT1/GENE_3659_IRF_1 pathway.
28624443	TC is a specific agonist of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (GENE_1269_CB2R).
28624443	Importantly, we further verified that the inhibitory effects of TC on the expression of GENE_3659_IRF_1 and GENE_7412_VCAM_1 are dependent on activation of CB2R.
28624443	Inhibition of CB2R by either specific inhibitors or RNA interference abolished the inhibitory effects of TC on the expression of GENE_3659_IRF_1 and GENE_7412_VCAM_1.
28624443	Our results suggest that TC might have a capacity to suppress the development of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28623112	Protective and prophylactic effects of CHEMICAL_D002726_chlorogenic_acid on CHEMICAL_D000535_aluminum-induced acute hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28623112	The possible health impact of the exposures to CHEMICAL__Al from environment would be inevitable for SPECIES_9606_humans.
28623112	Using chelating agents and natural antioxidants against CHEMICAL__Al-induced biotoxicity become a natural and modern way to prevent the adverse effects of CHEMICAL__Al in SPECIES_9606_people.
28623112	This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of CHEMICAL_D002726_chlorogenic_acid (CHEMICAL__CGA, CHEMICAL_C473200_5_O_caffeoylquinic_acid) in preventing CHEMICAL_C010845_aluminum_chloride (CHEMICAL_C010845_AlCl3) induced hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28623112	Control, CHEMICAL__Al-treated (a single injection of 25  mg CHEMICAL_36071_Al_3_/kg, i.p.
28623112	), CHEMICAL__Al  +  CHEMICAL__CGA (2  h after, a single dose of 100  mg/kg, i.p.
28623112	), CHEMICAL__CGA  +  CHEMICAL__Al (administered to SPECIES_10090_mice daily for 5 days at 30  mg/kg before CHEMICAL__Al-treatment) and group of CHEMICAL__CGA per se (administered to SPECIES_10090_mice daily for 5 days at 30  mg/kg) were used.
28623112	The levels of CHEMICAL__Al in liver and blood, the activities of transaminases in serum and osmotic fragility were increased by comparison with the control, while the activities of CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase and GENE_10090)_catalase decreased significantly in the CHEMICAL__Al-treated group.
28623112	However, treating SPECIES_10090_mice with CHEMICAL__CGA at either dosing regimens, post- or pre- CHEMICAL__Al administration alleviate CHEMICAL__Al oxidative damaging effects, stabilize cell membrane, prevent hepatocyte apoptosis.
28623112	CHEMICAL__CGA supplementation may be favorable to avoid CHEMICAL__Al-induced hematotoxicity and hepatotoxicity for SPECIES_9606_humans.
28623178	Adrenal-derived stress hormones modulate CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone-induced DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28623178	CHEMICAL_D010126_Ozone-induced systemic effects are modulated through activation of the neuro-hormonal stress response pathway.
28623178	DISEASE_D000312_Adrenal_demedullation (DEMED) or bilateral total adrenalectomy (ADREX) inhibits systemic and pulmonary effects of acute CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone exposure.
28623178	To understand the influence of adrenal-derived stress hormones in mediating CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone-induced DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury/DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, we assessed global gene expression (mRNA sequencing) and selected proteins in lung tissues from male Wistar-Kyoto SPECIES_10116_rats that underwent DEMED, ADREX, or sham surgery (SHAM) prior to their exposure to air or CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone (1ppm), 4h/day for 1 or 2days.
28623178	CHEMICAL_D010126_Ozone exposure significantly changed the expression of over 2300 genes in lungs of SHAM SPECIES_10116_rats, and these changes were markedly reduced in DEMED and ADREX SPECIES_10116_rats.
28623178	SHAM surgery but not DEMED or CHEMICAL__ADREX resulted in activation of multiple CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone-responsive pathways, including glucocorticoid, acute phase response, GENE_10116)_NRF2, and PI3K-AKT.
28623178	Predicted targets from sequencing data showed a similarity between transcriptional changes induced by CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone and adrenergic and steroidal modulation of effects in SHAM but not ADREX SPECIES_10116_rats.
28623178	CHEMICAL_D010126_Ozone-induced increases in lung GENE_10116)_Il6 in SHAM SPECIES_10116_rats coincided with DISEASE_D007249_neutrophilic_inflammation, but were diminished in DEMED and ADREX SPECIES_10116_rats.
28623178	Although CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone exposure in SHAM SPECIES_10116_rats did not significantly alter mRNA expression of Ifny and GENE_10116)_Il_4, the GENE_10116)_IL_4 protein and ratio of GENE_10116)_IL_4 to IFNy (GENE_10116)_IL_4_IFNy) proteins increased suggesting a tendency for a Th2 response.
28623178	This did not occur in ADREX and DEMED SPECIES_10116_rats.
28623178	We demonstrate that CHEMICAL_D010126_ozone-induced DISEASE_D055370_lung_injury and DISEASE_D007249_neutrophilic_inflammation require the presence of circulating CHEMICAL_D004837_epinephrine and CHEMICAL_D003345_corticosterone, which transcriptionally regulates signaling mechanisms involved in this response.
28623179	Modulation of TGF-b/Smad and GENE_10090)_ERK signaling pathways mediates the anti-fibrotic effect of CHEMICAL_C035133_mirtazapine in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28623179	CHEMICAL_D012701_Serotonin (CHEMICAL_D012701_5_HT) has been implicated as a key driver of DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis, acting via 5-HT2 receptor activation in the hepatic stellate cells.
28623179	The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of CHEMICAL_C035133_mirtazapine, a 5-HT2A antagonist, in a SPECIES_10090_mouse model of DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis.
28623179	SPECIES_10090_Mice received CHEMICAL_D013853_thioacetamide (CHEMICAL_32497_TAA, 150mg/kg/biweekly, ip) for nine successive weeks for induction of DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis.
28623179	Administration of CHEMICAL_C035133_mirtazapine significantly improved the plasma aminotransferases, reduced hepatic CHEMICAL_D012701_5_HT concentration and ameliorated CHEMICAL_32497_TAA-induced DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis, as demonstrated by reduced portal blood pressure, liver procollagen I content and a alpha smooth muscle actin expression.
28623179	Moreover, hepatic collagen deposition was markedly decreased in CHEMICAL_C035133_mirtazapine-treated SPECIES_10090_mice as evaluated by Masson's trichrome staining.
28623179	CHEMICAL_C035133_Mirtazapine provided an antifibrotic environment by decreasing the liver content of GENE_10090)_transforming_growth_factor_b1 (GENE_10090)_TGF_b1), and protein kinase C as well as the expression of phosphorylated-GENE_10090)_Smad3 (p-Smad) and phosphorylated GENE_26417;26413_extracellular_signal_regulated_kinases_1_and_2 (p-GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2).
28623179	Additionally, oxidative stress was largely mitigated by CHEMICAL_C035133_mirtazapine as manifested by decreased liver lipid peroxidation and GENE_10090)_NADPH_oxidase_1 along with CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione replenishment.
28623179	The current study indicates that CHEMICAL_C035133_mirtazapine suppressed CHEMICAL_D012701_5_HT-mediated GENE_10090)_TGF_b1/GENE_10090)_Smad3 and GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 signaling pathways as well as oxidative stress that contribute to the progression of DISEASE_D008103_liver_fibrosis.
28625492	CHEMICAL__CBMG, a novel derivative of CHEMICAL_C586321_mansonone_G suppresses adipocyte differentiation via suppression of PPARy activity.
28625492	Mansorins and CHEMICAL__mansonones have been isolated from Mansonia gagei heartwoods, a traditional herbal medicine used to treat DISEASE_D006333_heart_failure, and characterized to have anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor, and anti-estrogenic activities.
28625492	However, there is as yet no information on their effects on adipogenesis and lipid storage associated with DISEASE_D006331_heart_disease.
28625492	In this study, we investigated the effects of naturally occurring compounds on adipogenic differentiation and sought to develop more potent anti-adipogenic compound.
28625492	We found that CHEMICAL_C586321_mansonone_G (MG) suppressed adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, with a 40% decrease in lipid accumulation at 10   M. MG derivatives including ether and CHEMICAL_35701_ester analogues were then synthesized and assayed for their ability to suppress adipogenesis.
28625492	A novel MG derivative, CHEMICAL__chlorobenzoyl_MG (CHEMICAL__CBMG) most potently suppressed adipocyte differentiation with the decreased level of GENE_10090)_aP2 and GENE_10090)_adiponectin.
28625492	Interestingly, CHEMICAL__CBMG treatment decreased the expression of GENE_10090)_CCAAT_enhancer_binding_protein_a (GENE_10090)_C_EBPa) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPARy).
28625492	Further analysis confirmed that CHEMICAL__CBMG suppressed both the expression and activity of PPARy, a master regulator of adipogenesis, and subsequently led to decreases in transcription of GENE_10090)_C_EBPa, GENE_10090)_aP2, and GENE_10090)_adiponectin in adipogenesis, thereby attenuating adipocyte differentiation.
28625492	Our results suggest that a novel MG derivative, CHEMICAL__CBMG may have beneficial applications in the control of DISEASE_D009765_obesity through the suppression of PPARy-induced adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation.
28625800	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic alters transcriptional responses to SPECIES_287_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa infection and decreases antimicrobial defense of SPECIES_9606_human airway epithelial cells.
28625800	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic contamination of drinking water and food threatens the health of hundreds of millions of SPECIES_9606_people worldwide by increasing the risk of DISEASE_D004194_numerous_diseases.
28625800	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic exposure has been associated with DISEASE_D008171_infectious_lung_disease in epidemiological studies, but it is not yet understood how ingestion of low levels of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic increases susceptibility to DISEASE_D001424_bacterial_infection.
28625800	Accordingly, the goal of this study was to examine the effect of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic on gene expression in primary SPECIES_9606_human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and to determine if CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic altered epithelial cell responses to SPECIES_287_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen.
28625800	Bronchial epithelial cells line the airway surface, providing a physical barrier and serving critical roles in antimicrobial defense and signaling to professional immune cells.
28625800	We used RNA-seq to define the transcriptional response of HBE cells to SPECIES_287_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa, and investigated how CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic affected HBE gene networks in the presence and absence of the bacterial challenge.
28625800	Environmentally relevant levels of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic significantly changed the expression of genes involved in cellular redox homeostasis and host defense to DISEASE_D001424_bacterial_infection, and decreased genes that code for secreted antimicrobial factors such as lysozyme.
28625800	Using pathway analysis, we identified GENE_6659_Sox4 and GENE_4780_Nrf2-regulated gene networks that are predicted to mediate the CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced decrease in lysozyme secretion.
28625800	In addition, we demonstrated that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic decreased lysozyme in the airway surface liquid, resulting in reduced lysis of Microccocus luteus.
28625800	Thus, CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic alters the expression of genes and proteins in innate host defense pathways, thereby decreasing the ability of the lung epithelium to fight DISEASE_D001424_bacterial_infection.
28628672	Low-dose exposure to CHEMICAL__bisphenols_A, F and S of SPECIES_9606_human primary adipocyte impacts coding and non-coding RNA profiles.
28628672	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) exposure has been suspected to be associated with deleterious effects on health including DISEASE_D009765_obesity and metabolically-linked diseases.
28628672	Although CHEMICAL__bisphenols_F (CHEMICAL__BPF) and S (BPS) are CHEMICAL__BPA structural analogs commonly used in many marketed products as a replacement for CHEMICAL__BPA, only sparse toxicological data are available yet.
28628672	Our objective was to comprehensively characterize CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols gene targets in a SPECIES_9606_human primary adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a "low-dose" similar to the dose usually encountered in SPECIES_9606_human biological fluids and a higher dose.
28628672	Therefore, CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPF and CHEMICAL__BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10  M during the differentiation of SPECIES_9606_human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female SPECIES_9606_patients.
28628672	Gene expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding RNA changes.
28628672	We detected significantly deregulated mRNA/lncRNA and miRNA at low and high doses.
28628672	Enrichment in "DISEASE_D009369_cancer" and "organismal DISEASE_D004194_injury_and_abnormalities" related pathways was found in response to the three products.
28628672	Some long intergenic non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting that CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications.
28628672	The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that BPS and CHEMICAL__BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like CHEMICAL__BPA, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors.
28628672	All these results suggest that as CHEMICAL__BPA, its substitutes BPS and CHEMICAL__BPF should be used with the same restrictions.
28627408	Developmental exposure to CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-based herbicide and DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like behavior in adult offspring: Implication of CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.
28627408	We have previously demonstrated that maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) leads to CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate excitotoxicity in 15-day-old SPECIES_10116_rat hippocampus.
28627408	The present study was conducted in order to investigate the effects of subchronic exposure to GBH on some neurochemical and behavioral parameters in immature and adult offspring.
28627408	SPECIES_10116_Rats were exposed to 1% GBH in drinking water (corresponding to 0.36% of CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate) from gestational day 5 until postnatal day (PND)-15 or PND60.
28627408	Results showed that GBH exposure during both prenatal and postnatal periods causes oxidative stress, affects cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in offspring hippocampus from immature and adult SPECIES_10116_rats.
28627408	The subchronic exposure to the pesticide decreased CHEMICAL__L_14C_glutamate uptake and increased 45Ca2+ influx in 60-day-old SPECIES_10116_rat hippocampus, suggesting a persistent CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate excitotoxicity from developmental period (PND15) to adulthood (PND60).
28627408	Moreover, GBH exposure alters the serum levels of the astrocytic protein GENE_6285_S100B.
28627408	The effects of GBH exposure were associated with oxidative stress and DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like behavior in offspring on PND60, as demonstrated by the prolonged immobility time and decreased time of climbing observed in forced swimming test.
28627408	The mechanisms underlying the GBH-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity involve the CHEMICAL_D016202_NMDA receptor activation, impairment of cholinergic transmission, astrocyte dysfunction, GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 overactivation, decreased GENE_5970_p65 NF-kB phosphorylation, which are associated with oxidative stress and CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate excitotoxicity.
28627408	These neurochemical events may contribute, at least in part, to the DISEASE_D003866_depressive-like behavior observed in adult offspring.
28634229	Akt activation by CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (GENE_10645_CaMKK2) in DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer cells.
28634229	Hyperactivation of Akt is associated with oncogenic changes in the growth, survival, and chemoresistance of DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells.
28634229	The GENE_5163_PI3K_phosphoinositide_dependent_kinase_PDK_1 pathway represents the canonical mechanism for phosphorylation of Akt at its primary activation site, Thr-308.
28634229	We observed that CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (b) (GENE_10645_CaMKK2) is highly expressed in high-grade serous DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer, and we investigated its role in Akt activation in DISEASE_D010051_ovarian_cancer (DISEASE_D010051_OVCa) cell lines (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3, and Caov-3).
28634229	Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of GENE_10645_CaMKK2 produced phenotypes expected of Akt inhibition, including reductions in cell growth and cell viability and in the regulation of Akt downstream targets involved in G1/S transition and apoptosis.
28634229	GENE_10645_CaMKK2 knockdown or inhibition decreased Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 to extents similar to those of GENE_5163_PDK1 knockdown or GENE_5293_PI3K inhibition.
28634229	Combined GENE_10645_CaMKK2 and GENE_5163_PDK1 knockdown or GENE_10645_CaMKK and GENE_5293_PI3K inhibition, respectively, produced additive effects on p-Akt and cell growth, consistent with direct Akt phosphorylation by GENE_10645_CaMKK2.
28634229	This conclusion was supported by the absence of effects of GENE_10645_CaMKK2 knockdown/inhibition on alternative means of activating Akt via p-Akt Thr-450, p-GENE_5163_PDK1 Ser-241, or p-GENE_3667_IRS1 Ser-636/639.
28634229	Recombinant GENE_10645_CaMKK2 directly activated recombinant Akt by phosphorylation at Thr-308 in a CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_/CaM-dependent manner.
28634229	In DISEASE_D010051_OVCa cells, p-Akt Thr-308 was significantly inhibited by intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_i chelation or CaM inhibition.
28634229	CHEMICAL_D015759_Ionomycin-induced CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_ influx promoted p-Akt, an effect blocked by GENE_5163_PDK1, and/or GENE_10645_CaMKK2, siRNAs, and by GENE_5293_PI3K and/or GENE_10645_CaMKK inhibitors.
28634229	GENE_10645_CaMKK2 knockdown potentiated the effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs CHEMICAL_D016190_carboplatin and CHEMICAL_C496788_PX_866 to reduce proliferation and survival of DISEASE_D010051_OVCa cells.
28633978	Airborne nitro-PAHs induce GENE_4780_Nrf2/ARE defense system against oxidative stress and promote inflammatory process by activating GENE_5290_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt pathway in A549 cells.
28633978	Ambient particulate matter (PM) is a worldwide health issue of concern.
28633978	However, limited information is available regarding the toxic contributions of the CHEMICAL_29785_nitro-derivatives of CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs).
28633978	This study intend to examine whether CHEMICAL_C032668_1_nitropyrene (CHEMICAL__1_NP) and CHEMICAL_C033643_3_nitrofluoranthene (CHEMICAL__3_NF) could activate the GENE_4780_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2/antioxidant response element (GENE_4780_Nrf2/ARE) antioxidant defense system, and whether the CHEMICAL_D010716_phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (GENE_5290_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt) pathway participates in regulating pro-inflammatory responses in A549 cells.
28633978	Firstly, CHEMICAL__1_NP and CHEMICAL__3_NF concentration-dependently induced cellular apoptosis, reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage, S phase cell cycle arrest and differential expression of related cytokine genes.
28633978	Secondly, CHEMICAL__1_NP and CHEMICAL__3_NF activated the GENE_4780_Nrf2/ARE defense system, as evidenced by increased protein expression levels and nuclear translocation of transcription factor GENE_4780_Nrf2, elevated GENE_4780_Nrf2/ARE binding activity, up-regulated expression of the target gene GENE_3162_heme_oxygenase_1 (HO-1).
28633978	Significantly increased protein expression of GENE_5591_DNA_dependent_protein_kinase_catalytic_subunit (GENE_5591_DNA_PKcs) and phosphorylation level of GENE_207_Akt indicated that the GENE_5290_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt pathway was activated during pro-inflammatory process.
28633978	Further, both GENE_5290_PI3K inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002) and GENE_207_Akt inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C548887_MK_2206) reversed the elevated GENE_7124_TNF_a expression to control level.
28633978	Our results suggested that GENE_4780_Nrf2/ARE pathway activation might cause an initiation step in cellular protection against oxidative stress caused by nitro-PAHs, and the GENE_5290_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt pathway participated in regulating inflammatory responses.
28641223	Paternal CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_a diet changes prefrontal cortex proteome and provokes DISEASE_D001523_behavioral_dysfunction in male offspring.
28641223	Relatively little attention has been given paternal effects on next generation.
28641223	Given that CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), a ubiquitous compound in maternal diet, may disrupt brain development and behavior, we hypothesized that DISEASE_D001260_paternal_BPA_diet (DISEASE_D063129_PBD) could affect offspring development.
28641223	Prefrontal cortex (PFC), a vital brain region, is involved in emotion and social behavior.
28641223	To test whether DISEASE_D063129_PBD could alter developing PFC, we carried out a proteomics approach for PFC in male juvenile offspring that responded to DISEASE_D063129_PBD (50  mg CHEMICAL__BPA/kg diet).
28641223	We found that DISEASE_D063129_PBD altered the expressions of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), CCAAT/-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and DISEASE_D016393_B_cell_lymphoma_2 (DISEASE_D016393_BCL_2), which could reflect endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
28641223	In addition, downregulation of myelinogenesis genes and DISEASE_D003711_myelin_basic_protein_MBP_could_provoke_myelin_deficiency.
28641223	Furthermore, DISEASE_D063129_PBD significantly increased DISEASE_D001008_anxiety-like behavior and impaired social behavior in male offspring.
28641223	Taken together, these results revealed the alterations of ER stress and myelin destruction related molecules induced by DISEASE_D063129_PBD might be a potential mechanism for the behavior deficits in their male offspring.
28641223	These findings remind us of the importance of paternal effects in the further environmental exposure research.
28641963	Modulation of the heart's electrical properties by the anticonvulsant drug CHEMICAL_C101866_retigabine.
28641963	CHEMICAL_C101866_Retigabine, currently used as antiepileptic drug, has a wide range of potential medical uses.
28641963	Administration of the drug in SPECIES_9606_patients can lead to DISEASE_D008133_QT_interval_prolongation in the electrocardiogram and to DISEASE_D001145_cardiac_arrhythmias in rare cases.
28641963	This suggests that the drug may perturb the electrical properties of the heart, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated here.
28641963	Effects of CHEMICAL_C101866_retigabine on currents through SPECIES_9606_human cardiac ion channels, heterologously expressed in tsA-201 cells, were studied in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments.
28641963	In addition, the drug's impact on the cardiac action potential was tested.
28641963	This was done using ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from Langendorff-perfused SPECIES_10141_guinea_pig hearts and cardiomyocytes derived from SPECIES_9606_human induced pluripotent stem cells.
28641963	Further, to unravel potential indirect effects of CHEMICAL_C101866_retigabine on the heart which might involve the autonomic nervous system, membrane potential and CHEMICAL_D009638_noradrenaline release from sympathetic ganglionic neurons were measured in the absence and presence of the drug.
28641963	CHEMICAL_C101866_Retigabine significantly inhibited currents through GENE_169522_hKv11_1 CHEMICAL_D011188_potassium, GENE_6331_hNav1_5 CHEMICAL_D012964_sodium, as well as GENE_775_hCav1_2 CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium channels, but only in supra-therapeutic concentrations.
28641963	In a similar concentration range, the drug shortened the action potential in both SPECIES_10141_guinea_pig and SPECIES_9606_human cardiomyocytes.
28641963	Therapeutic concentrations of CHEMICAL_C101866_retigabine, on the other hand, were sufficient to inhibit the activity of sympathetic ganglionic neurons.
28641963	We conclude that CHEMICAL_C101866_retigabine- induced DISEASE_D008133_QT_interval_prolongation, and the reported cases of DISEASE_D001145_cardiac_arrhythmias after application of the drug in a typical daily dose range, cannot be explained by a direct modulatory effect on cardiac ion channels.
28641963	They are rather mediated by indirect actions at the level of the autonomic nervous system.
28641706	Delayed onset of puberty in male offspring from CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A-treated dams is followed by the modulation of gene expression in the hypothalamic?pituitary?testis DISEASE_C566610_axis in adulthood.
28641706	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemical of high prevalence in the environment, which may affect the function of the DISEASE_D007029_hypothalamic_pituitary_testis (DISEASE_D007029_HPT) DISEASE_C566610_axis in adult SPECIES_10116_rats.
28641706	The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA during hypothalamic sexual differentiation at doses below the reproductive no observable adverse effect level of the World Health Organization causes changes in the regulation of the DISEASE_D007029_HPT_axis.
28641706	For this, 0.5 or 5mgkg-1 CHEMICAL__BPA was injected subcutaneously to the mothers from gestational day 18 to postnatal day (PND) 5.
28641706	In adulthood (PND90), the mRNA expression of genes related to DISEASE_D007029_HPT_axis was evaluated in hypothalamus, pituitary and testis.
28641706	Hypothalamic expression of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (Gnrh) and GENE_10116)_estrogen_receptor_2 (GENE_10116)_Esr2) mRNA was increased in both CHEMICAL__BPA-treated groups compared to control group.
28641706	In the pituitary, GENE_10116)_follicle_stimulating_hormone_beta_subunit (GENE_10116)_Fshb) and CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor (GENE_10116)_Ar) mRNA expression was increased compared to control group in SPECIES_10116_rats treated with 0.5mgkg-1 of CHEMICAL__BPA, whereas GENE_10116)_estrogen_receptor_1 (GENE_10116)_Esr1) mRNA expression was only increased in the group treated with 5mgkg-1of CHEMICAL__BPA, compared to control group.
28641706	In the testis, there was increased expression of GENE_10116)_FSH_receptor (GENE_10116)_Fshr) and GENE_10116)_inhibin_beta_B_subunit (GENE_10116)_Inhbb) transcripts only in SPECIES_10116_rats treated with 0.5mgkg-1 of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28641706	Serum CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone and LH concentrations were increased in the group treated with 5mgkg-1of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28641706	The results of the present study demonstrate for the first time that perinatal exposure to low doses of CHEMICAL__BPA during the critical period of hypothalamic sexual differentiation modifies the activity of the DISEASE_D007029_HPT_axis in the offspring, with consequences for later life in adult SPECIES_10116_rats.
28645579	Anti-androgenic mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A involve CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor signaling pathway.
28645579	We have shown CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) acts as an GENE_367_androgen_receptor (GENE_367_AR) antagonist in the previous study.
28645579	However, the mechanisms underlying anti-androgenic effects of CHEMICAL__BPA remain unclear.
28645579	The objective of this study was to explore whether the GENE_367_AR signaling was involved in GENE_367_AR antagonism of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28645579	The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) iCELLigence system were applied to analyze the SPECIES_10090_mouse Sertoli cell TM4 proliferation.
28645579	The SPECIES_9606_mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed to investigate the effects of CHEMICAL__BPA on the GENE_367_AR CHEMICAL_46882_amino- and CHEMICAL__carboxyl-terminal regions (N/C) interaction and the interactions of the AR with CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid receptor coactivator-1 (GENE_8648_SRC_1), co-repressors including silencing mediator for thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and GENE_9611_nuclear_receptor_co_repressor (GENE_9611_NCoR).
28645579	CHEMICAL__BPA exposure resulted in decreased TM4 cell proliferation.
28645579	CHEMICAL__BPA inhibited the AR N/C interaction significantly.
28645579	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__BPA enhanced the interactions of GENE_367_AR-SMRT and AR-GENE_9611_NCoR significantly.
28645579	In conclusion, these data suggest CHEMICAL__BPA inhibits Sertoli cell proliferation due to its anti-androgenic actions.
28645579	The mechanisms responsible for GENE_367_AR antagonism of CHEMICAL__BPA involve inhibiting the GENE_367_AR N/C interaction and enhancing the interactions of GENE_367_AR-SMRT and AR-GENE_9611_NCoR.
28645579	The data uncover novel anti-androgenic mechanisms by which CHEMICAL__BPA antagonizes GENE_367_AR signaling, contributing to Sertoli cell proliferation suppression and SPECIES_9606_male reproductive toxicology.
28646569	Nanosilver particles increase follicular atresia: Correlation with oxidative stress and aromatization.
28646569	Present study was performed in order to update the possible mechanism(s), involving in nanosilver particles (NSPs)-induced detrimental impacts in ovarian tissue.
28646569	For this purpose, 24 mature female rats were divided into control and 0.5, 1, 5 mg/kg NSPs-received groups (intraperitoneally, for 35 days).
28646569	Follicular growth and atresia, ovarian total antioxidant capacity (TAC), CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA), CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents, serum CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen (E2 ) level and macrophages infiltration were investigated.
28646569	Moreover, ovarian angiogenesis, cellular mRNA damage and cytochrome aromatase CYP19 expression were analyzed.
28646569	The NSPs enhanced follicular atresia diminished E2, reduced TAC and SOD level, elevated CHEMICAL_566274_MDA content and up-regulated macrophages infiltration.
28646569	Cellular mRNA damage, impaired angiogenesis and diminished CYP19 expression were revealed in NSPs-received groups.
28646569	Therefore NSPs by down-regulating aromatization, reduce E2 synthesis which then it leads to impaired angiogenesis.
28646569	The impaired angiogenesis in turn down-regulates ovarian antioxidant status, which partially enhances follicular atresia by triggering lipid peroxidation and mRNA damage.
28648634	Impaired ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins in female SPECIES_10116_rat offspring born to mothers perinatally exposed to CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A.
28648634	The ovary is sensitive to disruption by the environmental CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA).
28648634	Our aim was to investigate whether perinatal exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA (50 g/kgday), orally administered, affects ovarian response to exogenous gonadotrophins (CHEMICAL__PMSG or CHEMICAL__PMSG+hCG) in prepubertal female offspring.
28648634	An altered response to gonadotrophins was observed in CHEMICAL__BPA-exposed SPECIES_10116_rats.
28648634	Increased proportion of antral follicles, altered levels of ovarian steroidogenic enzymes, gonadotropin receptors, AR and ERb were observed in CHEMICAL__PMSG group.
28648634	Besides that, in response to CHEMICAL__PMSG+hCG, a persistent high GENE_10116)_Fshr mRNA expression and a decreased number of follicles with high expression of PR before ovulation were observed.
28648634	After ovulation, there was an increase in antral atretic follicles, reduced GENE_10116)_Lhcgr mRNA expression and high serum levels of E2.
28648634	Therefore, an early exposure to a low dose of CHEMICAL__BPA during perinatal period induces ovarian changes leading to an altered response to exogenous gonadotropin treatment later in life.
28646487	Immunotoxic effects of thymus in SPECIES_10090_mice following exposure to nanoparticulate CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2.
28646487	CHEMICAL_C009495_Titanium_dioxide nanoparticles (CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs) have been extensively used in industry, medicine, and daily life, and have shown potential toxic effects for animals or SPECIES_9606_humans.
28646487	We noted that the effects of CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs on the immune system and its mechanism of action in animals or SPECIES_9606_humans have not been elucidated.
28646487	Thus, SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to the CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 mg  kg(-1) body weight) for 9 consecutive months.
28646487	Exposure to CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs was accumulated in the thymus, leading to a decrease in body weight and increases in the weight of the thymus or thymus indices.
28646487	In the blood, exposure to CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs significantly decreased white blood cell, red blood cell, reticulocyte, haemoglobin, and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration; and increased mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, platelets, and mean platelet volume.
28646487	The reductions of lymphocyte subsets, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, B cell, and natural killer cell, were observed in the CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NP-treated SPECIES_10090_mouse thymus.
28646487	Appearance of starry-sky aspect of the cortex that is given by the body of macrophages, bleeding, severe hemolysis or congestion, fatty degeneration, and cell apoptosis or necrosis were observed in the thymus following CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs exposure.
28646487	Importantly, CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs increased expression of nucleic factor-kB(NF-kB), GENE_10090)_IkB kinase1/2, GENE_10090)_interleukin_1b, GENE_10090)_interleukin_4, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, GENE_10090)_cyclooxygenase_2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, purinergic receptors-7, interferon-inducible protein 10, hypoxia inducible factor 1-a, p-c-Jun CHEMICAL__N-terminal kinase, p-p38, and p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein, respectively; whereas suppressed expression of GENE_10090)_IkB, peroxisome proliferater-activated receptor-y, trefoil factor 1, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1a, and CHEMICAL_D015232_prostaglandin_E2 proteins in the thymus, respectively.
28646487	Taken together, these results suggest that CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs exerts toxic effects on lymphoid organs and T cell and innate immune cell homeostasis in SPECIES_10090_mice and that these immunotoxic potential effects may result from the activation of NF-kB-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway.
28651000	Assessing the impact of CHEMICAL_D001564_Benzo_a_pyrene on Marine Mussels: Application of a novel targeted low density microarray complementing classical biomarker responses.
28651000	Despite the increasing use of mussels in environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological studies, their genomes and gene functions have not been thoroughly explored.
28651000	Several cDNA microarrays were recently proposed for Mytilus spp., but putatively identified partial transcripts have rendered the generation of robust transcriptional responses difficult in terms of pathway identification.
28651000	We developed a new low density oligonucleotide microarray with 465 probes covering the same number of genes.
28651000	Target genes were selected to cover most of the well-known biological processes in the stress response documented over the last decade in bivalve species at the cellular and tissue levels.
28651000	Our new 'STressREsponse Microarray' (STREM) platform consists of eight sub-arrays with three replicates for each target in each sub-array.
28651000	To assess the potential use of the new array, we tested the effect of the ubiquitous environmental pollutant CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P) at 5, 50, and 100  g/L on two target tissues, the gills and digestive gland, of SPECIES_29158_Mytilus_galloprovincialis exposed invivo for three days.
28651000	Bioaccumulation of CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P was also determined demonstrating exposure in both tissues.
28651000	In addition to the well-known effects of CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P on DNA metabolism and oxidative stress, the new array data provided clues about the implication of other biological processes, such as cytoskeleton, immune response, adhesion to substrate, and mitochondrial activities.
28651000	Transcriptional data were confirmed using qRT-PCR.
28651000	We further investigated cellular functions and possible alterations related to biological processes highlighted by the microarray data using oxidative stress biomarkers (Lipofuscin content) and the assessment of genotoxicity.
28651000	DNA damage, as measured by the alkaline comet assay, increased as a function of dose.DNA adducts measurements using 32P-postlabeling method also showed the presence of bulky DNA adducts (i.e.
28651000	dG-N2-CHEMICAL_D015123_BPDE).
28651000	CHEMICAL__Lipofiscin content increased significantly in CHEMICAL_29022_B_a_P exposed mussels.
28651000	Immunohistochemical analysis of tubulin and actin showed changes in cytoskeleton organisation.
28651000	Our results adopting an integrated approach confirmed that the combination of newly developed transcriptomic approcah, classical biomarkers along with chemical analysis of water and tissue samples should be considered for environmental bioimonitoring and ecotoxicological studies to obtain holistic information to assess the impact of contaminants on the SPECIES_131567_biota.
28647476	Substance P promotes hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation via the TGF-b1/Smad-3 signaling pathway.
28647476	Prolonged activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) usually results in the initiation and progression of liver DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis following injury.
28647476	Recent studies have shown that Substance SPECIES_2155_P_SP) participates in the development of DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28647476	However, whether SP is involved in liver DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis, especially in the activation and proliferation of HSCs, is largely unknown.
28647476	In the present study, we measured the effects of a series of concentrations of SP on the cell viability and activation of HSC-T6 cells and LX2 cells.
28647476	The underlying mechanism was also investigated.
28647476	We found that SP effectively increased cell viability, both in an CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay (p<0.05) and in a CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase activity assay (LDH) (p<0.05).
28647476	Moreover, SP upregulated the protein expression of a-SMA and Collagen I (both p<0.05) and decreased the release of lipid droplets (LDs) (p<0.05), all of which are associated with HSC activation.
28647476	Apoptosis analysis revealed that SP can attenuate the increase of cell apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal (p<0.05).
28647476	Furthermore, these effects were all blocked by an SP receptor antagonist, CHEMICAL__L732138.
28647476	More importantly, CHEMICAL__L732138 decreased the activation of the TGF-b1/Smad3 signaling pathway, which is highly associated with liver DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28647476	Taken together, our results demonstrate that SP can promote HSC proliferation and induce HSC activation via the TGF-b1/Smad3 signaling pathway.
28648595	Molecular evidence of offspring DISEASE_D008107_liver_dysfunction after maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_D015034_zinc_oxide nanoparticles.
28648595	Recently, reproductive, embryonic and developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity have been considered as one important sector of nanoparticle (NP) toxicology, with some studies already suggesting varying levels of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and possible transgenerational toxic effects.
28648595	Even though many studies have investigated the toxic effects of CHEMICAL_D015034_zinc_oxide nanoparticles (CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs), little is known of their impact on overall reproductive outcome and transgenerational effects.
28648595	Previously we found CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs caused DISEASE_D008107_liver_dysfunction in lipid synthesis.
28648595	This investigation, for the first time, explored the DISEASE_D008107_liver_dysfunction at the molecular level of gene and protein expression in offspring after maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs.
28648595	Three pathways were investigated: lipid synthesis, growth related factors and cell toxic biomarkers/apoptosis at 5 different time points from embryonic day-18 to postnatal day-20.
28648595	It was found that the expression of 15, 16, and 16 genes in lipid synthesis, growth related factors and cell toxic biomarkers/apoptosis signalling pathway respectively in F1 animal liver were altered by CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs compared to CHEMICAL_35176_ZnSO4.
28648595	The proteins in these signalling pathways (five in each pathways analyzed) in F1 animal liver were also changed by CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs compared to CHEMICAL_35176_ZnSO4.
28648595	The results suggest that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs caused maternal DISEASE_D056486_liver_defects can also be detected in offspring that might result in problems on offspring liver development, mainly on lipid synthesis, growth, and lesions or apoptosis.
28648595	Along with others, this study suggests that CHEMICAL_50836_ZnO NPs may pose reproductive, embryonic and developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity; therefore, precautions should be taken with regard to SPECIES_9606_human exposure during daily life.
28648817	Modulatory effect of silymarin on nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 regulated redox status, nuclear factor-kB mediated DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and apoptosis in experimental gastric DISEASE_D014456_ulcer.
28648817	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumption has been commonly associated with DISEASE_D009059_gastric_mucosal_lesions including gastric DISEASE_D014456_ulcer.
28648817	Silymarin (SM) is a CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid mixture with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities which explain its protective role against hepatic and DISEASE_D007674_renal_injuries.
28648817	However, its impact on gastric DISEASE_D014456_ulcer has not yet been elucidated.
28648817	Thus we went further to investigate the potential protective effects of SM against CHEMICAL_D007213_indomethacin-induced DISEASE_D013272_gastric_injury in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28648817	Pretreatment with SM (50  mg/kg orally) attenuated the severity of DISEASE_D013272_gastric_mucosal_damage as evidenced by decreasing DISEASE_D014456_ulcer index (UI) and DISEASE_D014456_ulcer score, improvement of disturbed histopathologicl features to be insignificant with those induced by the reference anti-DISEASE_D014456_ulcer drug.
28648817	Pretreatment with SM also suppressed DISEASE_D013274_gastric_inflammation by decreasing myeloperoxidase activity, GENE_10116)_tumer_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_10116)_TNF_a) and GENE_10116)_interleukin_6 (GENE_10116)_IL6) levels along with GENE_10116)_nuclear_factor_kappa_B_p65 (GENE_10116)_NF_kB) expression.
28648817	Meanwhile, SM prevent gastric oxidative stress via inhibition of lipid peroxides formation, enhancement of CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase, CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase activities and up-regulation of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (GENE_10116)_Nrf2), the redox-sensitive master regulator of oxidative stress signaling.
28648817	In conclusion, the results herein revealed that SM has a gastro-protective effect which is mediated via suppression of DISEASE_D013274_gastric_inflammation, oxidative stress, increased the anti-oxidant and the cyto-protective defense mechanisms.
28655646	CHEMICAL_D014807_Vitamin_D deficiency impairs testicular development and spermatogenesis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28655646	CHEMICAL_D014807_Vitamin_D deficiency is prevalent especially in SPECIES_9606_men.
28655646	Nevertheless, whether CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D deficiency impairs male reproduction remains under debate.
28655646	The aim of this study is to investigate whether CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D deficiency has an impact on testicular development and spermatogenesis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28655646	In the control group and CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D deficient (VDD) diet group, dams and their pups were fed with standard-chow diet and VDD diet, respectively.
28655646	Interestingly, testicular weight and sperm quality are reduced, testicular germ cell proliferation is suppressed, and the percentage of mature seminiferous tubules is decreased in VDD diet-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28655646	Moreover, testicular CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone (T) synthesis enzymes are down-regulated in VDD diet-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28655646	Correspondingly, serum and testicular T levels are reduced in VDD diet-fed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28655646	Importantly, fertility index is reduced and live fetuses are decreased when both males and females are fed with VDD diet.
28655646	These results provide evidence that CHEMICAL_D014807_vitamin_D deficiency impairs testicular development and spermatogenesis.
28657538	Effects of Low-Dose Developmental CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A Exposure on Metabolic Parameters and Gene Expression in Male and Female Fischer 344 SPECIES_10116_Rat Offspring.
28657538	BACKGROUND: CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that may contribute to development of DISEASE_D009765_obesity and DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_disorders.
28657538	SPECIES_9606_Humans are constantly exposed to low concentrations of CHEMICAL__BPA, and studies support that the developmental period is particularly sensitive.
28657538	OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the effects of low-dose developmental CHEMICAL__BPA exposure on metabolic parameters in male and female Fischer 344 (F344) SPECIES_10116_rat offspring.
28657538	METHODS: Pregnant F344 SPECIES_10116_rats were exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA via their drinking water, corresponding to (CHEMICAL__BPA0.5; ) or (CHEMICAL__BPA50_ ), from gestational day (GD) 3.5 until postnatal day (PND) 22, and controls were given vehicle ().
28657538	Body weight (BW), adipose tissue, liver (weight, histology, and gene expression), heart weight, and lipid profile were investigated in the 5-wk-old offspring.
28657538	RESULTS: Males and females exhibited differential susceptibility to the different doses of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28657538	Developmental CHEMICAL__BPA exposure increased plasma CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride levels ( compared with , females CHEMICAL__BPA50 ; compared with , males CHEMICAL__BPA0.5 ) in F344 SPECIES_10116_rat offspring compared with controls.
28657538	CHEMICAL__BPA exposure also increased adipocyte cell density by 122% in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of female offspring exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA0.5 compared with controls ( number of adipocytes/DISEASE_D005128_HPF compared with number of adipocytes/DISEASE_D005128_HPF; ) and by 123% in CHEMICAL__BPA0.5 females compared with CHEMICAL__BPA50 animals ( number of DISEASE_D005128_adipocytes_high_power_field (DISEASE_D005128_HPF) compared with number of adipocytes/DISEASE_D005128_HPF; ).
28657538	In iWAT of male offspring, adipocyte cell density was increased by 129% in CHEMICAL__BPA50-exposed animals compared with CHEMICAL__BPA0.5-exposed animals ( number of adipocytes/DISEASE_D005128_HPF compared with number of adipocytes/DISEASE_D005128_HPF; ).
28657538	Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in lipid and adipocyte homeostasis was significantly different between exposed animals and controls depending on the tissue, dose, and sex.
28657538	CONCLUSIONS: Developmental exposure to of CHEMICAL__BPA, which is 8-10 times lower than the current preliminary EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) tolerable daily intake (TDI) of and is within the range of environmentally relevant levels, was associated with sex-specific differences in the expression of genes in adipose tissue plasma CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride levels in males and adipocyte cell density in females when F344 SPECIES_10116_rat offspring of dams exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA at were compared with the offspring of unexposed controls.

28659758	Chronic Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, GENE_10116)_Nrf2 Activation and Inflammation in the Hippocampus Accompany DISEASE_D007249_Heightened_Systemic_Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in an Animal Model of Gulf War Illness.
28659758	DISEASE_D008569_Memory_and_mood_dysfunction are the key symptoms of Gulf war illness (GWI), a lingering multi-symptom ailment afflicting >200,000 veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War-1.
28659758	Research probing the source of the disease has demonstrated that concomitant exposures to anti-nerve gas agent CHEMICAL_D011729_pyridostigmine_bromide (PB), pesticides, and war-related stress are among the chief causes of GWI.
28659758	Indeed, exposures to GWI-related chemicals (GWIR-Cs) and mild stress in animal models cause memory and mood impairments alongside reduced neurogenesis and chronic low-level DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in the hippocampus.
28659758	In the current study, we examined whether exposure to GWIR-Cs and stress causes chronic changes in the expression of genes related to increased oxidative stress, DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction, and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in the hippocampus.
28659758	We also investigated whether GWI is linked with chronically increased activation of GENE_10116)_Nrf2 (a master regulator of antioxidant response) in the hippocampus, and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and enhanced oxidative stress at the systemic level.
28659758	Adult male SPECIES_10116_rats were exposed daily to low-doses of PB and pesticides (DEET and CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin), in combination with 5 min of restraint stress for 4 weeks.
28659758	Analysis of the hippocampus performed 6 months after the exposure revealed increased expression of many genes related to oxidative stress response and/or antioxidant activity (GENE_10116)_Hmox1, GENE_10116)_Sepp1, and GENE_10116)_Srxn1), reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species metabolism (GENE_10116)_Fmo2, GENE_10116)_Sod2, and GENE_10116)_Ucp2) and CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen transport (GENE_10116)_Ift172 and GENE_10116)_Slc38a1).
28659758	Furthermore, multiple genes relevant to mitochondrial respiration (Atp6a1, GENE_10116)_Cox6a1, GENE_10116)_Cox7a2L, GENE_10116)_Ndufs7, GENE_10116)_Ndufv1, GENE_10116)_Lhpp, GENE_10116)_Slc25a10, and GENE_10116)_Ucp1) and neuroinflammation (GENE_10116)_Nfkb1, GENE_10116)_Bcl6, GENE_10116)_Csf2, GENE_10116)_IL6, GENE_10116)_Mapk1, GENE_10116)_Mapk3, GENE_10116)_Ngf, N-pac, and Prkaca) were up-regulated, alongside 73-88% reduction in the expression of anti-inflammatory genes GENE_10116)_IL4 and GENE_10116)_IL10, and nuclear translocation and increased expression of GENE_10116)_Nrf2 protein.
28659758	These hippocampal changes were associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (GENE_10116)_Tnfa, GENE_10116)_IL1b, GENE_10116)_IL1a, GENE_10116)_Tgfb, and GENE_10116)_Fgf2) and lipid peroxidation byproduct CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde in the serum, suggesting the presence of an incessant systemic DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and elevated oxidative stress.
28659758	These results imply that chronic oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction in the hippocampus, and heightened systemic DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and oxidative stress likely underlie the persistent memory and mood dysfunction observed in GWI.
28655636	Diesel exhaust particulate associated chemicals attenuate expression of GENE_3627_CXCL10 in SPECIES_9606_human primary bronchial epithelial cells.
28655636	Air pollution affects a large proportion of the population particularly in urban areas, with diesel particulates recognised as particular causes for concern in respiratory conditions such as DISEASE_D001249_asthma.
28655636	In this study we examined the response of SPECIES_9606_human primary airway epithelial cells to diesel particulate chemical extracts (DE) and characterised gene expression alterations using RNA-SEQ.
28655636	Using the antagonist CHEMICAL_C511621_CH223191, DE induced GENE_1543_CYP1A1 and attenuation of GENE_3627_CXCL10 among other genes were observed to be CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor dependent.
28655636	Basal and toll like receptor dependent protein levels for GENE_3627_CXCL10 were markedly reduced.
28655636	Investigation of similar regulation in plasmacytoid dendritic GEN2.2 cells did not show DE dependent regulation of GENE_3627_CXCL10.
28655636	Instillation of DE into SPECIES_10090_mice to recapitulate airway epithelial exposure to chemical extracts in an in vivo setting failed to demonstrate a reduction in GENE_10090)_CXCL10.
28655636	There was however an increase in the Th2 type epithelial cell derived inflammatory mediators GENE_85480_TSLP and GENE_5055_SERPINB2.
28655636	We also observed an increased macrophages and a decrease in the proportion of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
28655636	GENE_3627_CXCL10 can play a role in allergic airway disease through recruitment of GENE_51497_Th1 type CD4+ T-cells, which can act to counterbalance Th2 type allergic responses.
28655636	Modulation of such chemokines within the airway epithelium may represent a mechanism through which pollutant material can modify respiratory conditions such as DISEASE_D004342_allergic_asthma.
28655647	Evaluation of the effects of CHEMICAL__a_cypermethrin on fetal SPECIES_10116_rat testicular steroidogenesis.
28655647	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats were administered the insecticide CHEMICAL__a_cypermethrin at doses of 0.1, 1, 5, or 10mg/kg/day, or CHEMICAL_C025605_di_isobutyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL__DIBP) at 250mg/kg/day, by gavage, from gestation day (GD) 13 to 19.
28655647	Testicular CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production and the expression of several key genes related to CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol and CHEMICAL_50113_androgen synthesis and transport were assessed in GD 19 male fetuses.
28655647	Dams treated with 10mg/kg/day of CHEMICAL__a_cypermethrin showed clinical signs of DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity and reduced body DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain.
28655647	CHEMICAL__a_Cypermethrin had no significant effect on post-implantation loss, fetal weight, incidence of male fetuses per litter, or anogenital distance of the male fetuses.
28655647	In the fetal testes, mRNA expressions of CHEMICAL_C008047_HMG_CoA synthase and reductase, GENE_10116)_SRB1, GENE_10116)_StAR, P450scc, 3bHSD, P450 17A1, and 17bHSD were not affected by exposure to CHEMICAL__a_cypermethrin.
28655647	CHEMICAL_D013739_Testosterone production by the fetal testis was significantly reduced at 5 and 10mg/kg/day of CHEMICAL__a_cypermethrin, although to a much smaller extent than in CHEMICAL__DIBP-exposed fetuses.
28659405	Fish Oil Contaminated with Persistent Organic Pollutants Induces Colonic Aberrant Crypt Foci Formation and Reduces Antioxidant Enzyme Gene Expression in SPECIES_10116_Rats.
28659405	Background: Epidemiologic, clinical, and experimental studies have suggested that fish oil (FO), a rich source of n-3 (  -3) CHEMICAL_D005231_polyunsaturated_fatty_acids, protects against DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer.
28659405	However, this message is confounded by the FDA's warning that the consumption of certain types of fish should be restricted because of contamination with persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as CHEMICAL_D011078_polychlorinated_biphenyls (CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs) and CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticides.Objective: We examined FO contaminated with POPs (CHEMICAL_D011078_PCBs, CHEMICAL_16130_dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and CHEMICAL_D002706_chlordane) compared with unmodified FO on the risk factors of DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer development.Methods: Male SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats aged 28 d (n = 30) were allocated into 3 groups and fed 15% SPECIES_381124_corn oil (CO), FO, or POP-contaminated FO for 9 wk with a subcutaneous injection of colon carcinogen CHEMICAL_D001397_azoxymethane at weeks 3 and 4.
28659405	Colonic DISEASE_D058739_aberrant_crypt_foci (DISEASE_D058739_ACF) and cell proliferation were enumerated, and the gene expression of inflammation, antioxidant enzymes, and repair enzymes were determined with the use of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.Results: FO-fed SPECIES_10116_rats had a lower number of DISEASE_D058739_ACF (mean    SE: 29    4.0 for FO compared with 53    8.4 for CO and 44    4.6 for POP FO) and higher-multiplicity DISEASE_D058739_ACF than the CO and POP FO groups (4.7    0.9 for FO compared with 11    1.5 for CO and 9.6    1.8 for POP FO) (P < 0.05).
28659405	FO feeding lowered the proliferation index compared with the CO and POP FO feeding groups (18%    1.1% for FO compared with 25%    1.6% for CO and 23%    0.7% for POP FO) (P = 0.009).
28659405	CHEMICAL_D013481_Superoxide dismutase [2.4    0.6 relative quantification (RQ) for FO compared with 1.2    0.2 RQ for CO and 1.3    0.3 RQ for POP FO] and catalase gene expression (10    2.0 RQ for FO compared with 5.4    1.1 RQ for CO and 6.6    1.5 RQ for POP FO) were higher in the FO group than in the CO and POP FO groups (P < 0.05).
28659405	There were no differences between CO and POP FO on the variables.Conclusion: These results indicate that POPs in FO reduce the preventive effects of FO on colon carcinogenesis by increasing preneoplastic lesion formation through the downregulation of antioxidant enzyme expression and increasing cell proliferation in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28665548	Effect of CHEMICAL_C005948_astaxanthin and CHEMICAL_C010845_aluminum_chloride on erythrocyte GENE_10116)_G6PD and 6PGD enzyme activities in vivo and on erythrocyte GENE_10116)_G6PD in vitro in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28665548	In this study, we investigated the effect of CHEMICAL_C005948_astaxanthin (CHEMICAL__Ast) and CHEMICAL_D000535_aluminum (CHEMICAL__Al) on the erythrocyte CHEMICAL_D019298_glucose_6_phosphate dehydrogenase (GENE_10116)_G6PD) and CHEMICAL_C008884_6_phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) enzymes activities in vivo and on GENE_10116)_G6PD enzyme in vitro in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28665548	For in vitro studies, GENE_10116)_G6PD enzyme was purified from SPECIES_10116_rat erythrocyte by using CHEMICAL__2_5_ADP_Sepharose_4B affinity gel.
28665548	The effects of CHEMICAL__Ast and CHEMICAL_36071_Al3_ ion were investigated on the purified enzyme.
28665548	It was determined that CHEMICAL__Ast increased the enzyme activity, whereas CHEMICAL_36071_Al3_ inhibited the enzyme activity noncompetitively (IC50 values; 0.679  mM, Ki values 1.32  mM).
28665548	For in vivo studies, the SPECIES_10116_rats were divided into the groups: control (Cont.
28665548	), CHEMICAL__Al, CHEMICAL__Ast, and CHEMICAL__Al  +  CHEMICAL__Ast.
28665548	The last three groups were compared with the control group.
28665548	In CHEMICAL__Al group, a significant degree of inhibition was observed in the activity of GENE_10116)_G6PD and 6PGD enzymes when compared with the control group (P  <  0.05), whereas there was an increase in the activities of GENE_10116)_G6PD and 6PGD enzymes in CHEMICAL__Ast and CHEMICAL__Al  +  CHEMICAL__Ast groups (P  <  0.05).
28666365	Chronic low-dose CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium exposure impairs cutaneous wound healing with defective early inflammatory responses after DISEASE_D012871_skin_injury.
28666365	Impairment of the immune system is a developing concern in evaluating the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium (CHEMICAL__Cd).
28666365	In the present study, we investigated if CHEMICAL__Cd could impair cutaneous wound healing through interfering with DISEASE_D007249_inflammation after injury.
28666365	We found that exposure of SPECIES_10090_mice to CHEMICAL_D019256_CdCl2 through drinking water at doses of 10, 30 and 50   mg/L for 8 weeks significantly impaired cutaneous wound healing.
28666365	Chronic 30   mg/L CHEMICAL_D019256_CdCl2 treatment elevated SPECIES_10090_murine blood CHEMICAL__Cd level comparable to that of low dose CHEMICAL__Cd-exposed SPECIES_9606_humans, had no effect on blood total and differential leukocyte counts, but reduced neutrophil infiltration, chemokines (GENE_2919_CXCL1, GENE_2920_CXCL2) and proinflammatory cytokines (GENE_7124_TNFa, GENE_3553_IL_1b, and GENE_3569_IL_6) expression in wounded tissue at early stage after injury.
28666365	Wounded tissue homogenates from CHEMICAL_D019256_CdCl2-treated SPECIES_10090_mice had lower chemotactic activity for neutrophils than those from untreated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28666365	Mechanistic studies showed that chronic CHEMICAL__Cd treatment suppressed GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 and NF-kB GENE_10090)_p65 phosphorylation in wounded tissue at early stage after injury.
28666365	Compared with neutrophils isolated from untreated SPECIES_10090_mice, neutrophils from CHEMICAL_D019256_CdCl2 treated SPECIES_10090_mice and normal neutrophils treated with CHEMICAL_D019256_CdCl2 in vitro both had lower chemotactic response, CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium mobilization and GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 phosphorylation upon chemoattractant stimulation.
28666365	Collectively, our study indicate that chronic low-dose CHEMICAL__Cd exposure impaired cutaneous wound healing by reducing neutrophil infiltration through inhibiting chemokine expression and neutrophil chemotactic response, and suppressing proinflammatory cytokine expression.
28666365	CHEMICAL__Cd may suppresse chemokine and proinflammatory expression through inactivating GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 and NF-kB, and inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis by attenuating CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium mobilization and GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 phosphorylation in response to chemoattractants.
28666766	Toxicogenomic responses of SPECIES_9606_human alveolar epithelial cells to CHEMICAL__tungsten_boride nanoparticles.
28666766	During the recent years, microarray analysis of gene expression has become an inevitable tool for exploring DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of drugs and other chemicals on biological systems.
28666766	Therefore, toxicogenomics is considered as a fruitful area for searching cellular pathways and mechanisms including DISEASE_D009369_cancer, DISEASE_D007154_immunological_diseases, environmental responses, gene-gene interactions and chemical DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28666766	In this work, we examined toxic effects of CHEMICAL__Tungsten_Borides NPs on gene expression profiling of the SPECIES_9606_human lung alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC).
28666766	In line with this purpose, a single crystal of CHEMICAL__tungsten_boride (mixture of WB and W2B) nanoparticles was synthesized by means of zone melting method, and characterized via using X-SPECIES_255564_ray crystallography (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-SPECIES_255564_ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques.
28666766	Cell viability and DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity were determined by CHEMICAL_C022616_3_4_5_dimethyl_thiazol_2_yl_2_5_diphenyltetrazolium_bromide (CHEMICAL_53233_MTT), CHEMICAL__neutral_red (NR) and CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release tests.
28666766	The whole genome microarray expression analysis was performed to find out the effects of WB and W2B NPs mixture on gene expression of the HPAEpiC cell culture.
28666766	123 of 40,000 gene probes were assigned to characterize expression profile for WB/W2B NPs exposure.
28666766	According to results; 70 genes were up-regulated and 53 genes were down-regulated (>= 2 fold change).
28666766	For further investigations, these genes were functionally classified by using DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) with gene ontology (GO) analysis.
28666766	In the light of the data gained from this study, it could be concluded that the mixture of WB/W2B NPs can affect cytokine/chemokine metabolism, angiogenesis and prevent migration/invasion by activating various genes.
28666825	CHEMICAL_C084079_Triptonide acts as a novel potent anti-DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma agent with DISEASE_D064420_low_toxicity mainly through inhibition of proto-oncogene Lyn transcription and suppression of Lyn signal pathway.
28666825	Lyn is a proto-oncogene overexpressed and constitutively activated in DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma, and plays an important role in DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma initiation and malignant progression.
28666825	Hence, the oncogenic Lyn has recently been targeted for novel anti-DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma drug discovery; however, the effective Lyn-targeted drug for DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma treatment with DISEASE_D064420_low_toxicity is absent in the clinical setting.
28666825	The goal of this study is to explore powerful and low toxic Lyn-targeted anti-DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma agent.
28666825	Here we show that CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide, a small molecule purified from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, potently inhibits the proliferation of human DISEASE_D016393_B_lymphoma Raji and DISEASE_D016399_T_lymphoma Jurkat cells with IC50 of 5.7nM and 4.8nM, respectively.
28666825	Strikingly, CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide at a dose of 5mg/kg/day almost completely inhibited the DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma growth in human DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma cells-xenografted mice without obvious side effects, particularly; the DISEASE_D009369_tumors in 6 mice among the 8 xenografted mice were completely eradicated in vivo.
28666825	Cell biological studies showed that CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide at the doses of 2.5-10nM notably suppressed DISEASE_D016393_B_lymphoma cell colony-forming capability, and that CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide at the dose of 20nM promoted apoptosis through activation of PARP and caspase 3, but reduction of BCL2 protein levels in the DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma cells.
28666825	Molecular studies revealed that CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide markedly inhibited oncogenic Lyn transcription through suppressing the promoter activity of the gene, and that it remarkably reduced both total and phosphorylated Lyn proteins, and diminished Lyn downstream ERK and ATK signal pathways.
28666825	Additionally, CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide significantly enhanced p38 phosphorylation.
28666825	Together, CHEMICAL_C084079_triptonide exerts potent anti-DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma effect with DISEASE_D064420_low_toxicity mainly through inhibition of proto-oncogene Lyn transcription and suppression of Lyn downstream ERK and ATK signal pathways, providing an attractive drug candidate for development of novel anti-DISEASE_D008223_lymphoma therapeutics.
28668616	Influence of CHEMICAL_D044948_flavonols and CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin derivative compounds on MA-10 Leydig cells steroidogenic genes expressions.
28668616	CHEMICAL_50113_Androgen are mainly synthesized and secreted from testicular Leydig cells and play critical roles in testis development, normal masculinization, spermatogenesis, and male fertility.
28668616	The rate-limiting step in CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone biosynthesis involves the import of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol inside mitochondria by the GENE_6770_steroidogenic_acute_regulatory (GENE_6770_Star) protein.
28668616	CHEMICAL_D002784_Cholesterol is then converted to CHEMICAL_D011284_pregnenolone by the steroidogenic enzyme GENE_1583_Cyp11a1, followed by a chemical transformation to CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone using other steroidogenic enzymes.
28668616	Interestingly, levels of GENE_6770_Star protein within adult Leydig cells decrease during aging, resulting in defective mitochondrial CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol transfer and reduced CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production.
28668616	Such decline may be delayed by increasing GENE_6770_Star and/or GENE_1583_Cyp11a1 gene expressions using supplementation with CHEMICAL_D005419_flavonoids, a group of the CHEMICAL__polyphenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables.
28668616	In this study, we examined whether the distribution of CHEMICAL_D017665_hydroxyl groups and/or acetylation or methylation of CHEMICAL_D044948_flavonols could influence their potency to stimulate steroidogenesis within Leydig cells.
28668616	Low levels of CHEMICAL_D011794_quercetin, CHEMICAL_C040015_myricetin and CHEMICAL__pentaacetylquercetin (10 M) stimulated CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP-dependent GENE_6770_Star, GENE_1583_Cyp11a1 and GENE_2230_Fdx1 promoters' activations and may increase steroidogenesis within Leydig cells.
28668616	Indeed, CHEMICAL__pentaacetylquercetin successfully increased CHEMICAL_17489_cAMP-dependent accumulation of CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone from MA-10 Leydig cells, possibly through activation of GENE_6770_Star and GENE_1583_Cyp11a1 transcriptions.
28668616	Thus, dietary supplementation of CHEMICAL__pentaacetylquercetin could be potentially effective to maintain CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone production within aging males.
28668442	CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol has anti-thyroid effects both in  vitro and in  vivo.
28668442	CHEMICAL_C059514_Resveratrol is a natural CHEMICAL_26195_polyphenol with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative properties.
28668442	We have shown previously that CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol decreases CHEMICAL_D012964_sodium/CHEMICAL_16382_iodide symporter expression and CHEMICAL_16382_iodide uptake in thyrocytes, both in  vitro and in  vivo.
28668442	In the present study, we further investigated the effects of CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol, with evaluation of the expression of additional thyroid-specific genes in the SPECIES_10116_FRTL_5 SPECIES_10116_rat thyroid cell line: GENE_10116)_thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, TSH receptor, GENE_10116)_Nkx2_1, GENE_10116)_Foxe1 and GENE_10116)_Pax8.
28668442	We observed decreased expression of these genes in SPECIES_10116_FRTL_5  cells treated with 10   M CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol.
28668442	The effects of CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol was further evaluated in  vivo using SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats treated with CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol 25  mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally, for 60 days.
28668442	No clinical signs of DISEASE_D007037_hypothyroidism were seen, although the treated SPECIES_10116_rats showed significant increase in thyroid size.
28668442	Serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels were in the normal range, with significantly higher TSH seen in CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol-treated SPECIES_10116_rats, compared with control SPECIES_10116_rats.
28668442	Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed increased proliferative activity in the thyroid from CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol-treated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28668442	These data suggest that CHEMICAL_C059514_resveratrol acts as a thyroid disruptor and a CHEMICAL__goitrogen, which indicates the need for caution as a supplement and for therapeutic uses.
28673560	Down-regulation of the expression of GENE_127_alcohol_dehydrogenase_4 and GENE_1571_CYP2E1 by the combination of CHEMICAL__a_endosulfan and CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin in HepaRG SPECIES_9606_human cells.
28673560	Pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants are considered as risk factors for liver diseases.
28673560	We treated the SPECIES_9606_human hepatic cell line HepaRG with both CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (TCDD) and the CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticide, CHEMICAL__a_endosulfan, to evaluate their combined impact on the expression of hepatic genes involved in CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol metabolism.
28673560	We show that the combination of the two pollutants (25nM TCDD and 10 M CHEMICAL__a_endosulfan) led to marked decreases in the amounts of both the mRNA (up to 90%) and protein (up to 60%) of GENE_127_ADH4 and GENE_1571_CYP2E1.
28673560	Similar results were obtained following 24h or 8days of treatment with lower concentrations of these pollutants.
28673560	Experiments with siRNA and GENE_196_AHR agonists and antagonist demonstrated that the genomic GENE_196_AHR/GENE_405_ARNT pathway is necessary for the CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin effect.
28673560	The GENE_8856_PXR, GENE_653108;2099_CAR_and_estrogen_receptor_alpha transcription factors were not modulators of the effects of CHEMICAL__a_endosulfan, as assessed by siRNA transfection.
28673560	In another SPECIES_9606_human hepatic cell line, HepG2, TCDD decreased the expression of GENE_127_ADH4 and GENE_1571_CYP2E1 mRNAs whereas CHEMICAL__a_endosulfan had no effect on these genes.
28673560	Our results demonstrate that exposure to a mixture of pollutants may deregulate hepatic metabolism.
28673683	Single-walled CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) inhibit GENE_3320_heat_shock_protein_90 (GENE_3320_HSP90) signaling in SPECIES_9606_human lung fibroblasts and keratinocytes.
28673683	Single-walled CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon-based nanomaterials that possess immense industrial potential.
28673683	Despite accumulating evidence that exposure to SWCNTs might be toxic to SPECIES_9606_humans, our understanding of the mechanisms for cellular DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of SWCNTs remain limited.
28673683	Here, we demonstrated that acute exposure of short (1-3 m) and regular-length (5-30 m) pristine, carboxylated or hydroxylated SWCNTs inhibited cell proliferation in SPECIES_9606_human somatic and SPECIES_9606_human stem cells in a cell type-dependent manner.
28673683	The DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of regular-length pristine SWCNT was most evidenced in NP69>CHEMICAL__CYT00086>MCF-10A>MRC-5>HaCaT > HEK-293T>HepG2.
28673683	In contrast, the short pristine SWCNTs were relatively less toxic in most of the cells being tested, except for NP69 which is more sensitive to short pristine SWCNTs as compared to regular-length pristine SWCNTs.
28673683	Interestingly, carboxylation and hydroxylation of regular-length SWCNTs, but not the short SWCNTs, significantly reduced the DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28673683	Exposure of SWCNTs also induced GENE_836_caspase_3 and 9 activities, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and significant apoptosis and DISEASE_D009336_necrosis in MRC-5 embryonic lung fibroblasts.
28673683	In contrast, SWCNTs inhibited the proliferation of HaCaT SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes without inducing cell death.
28673683	Further analyses by gene expression profiling and Connectivity Map analysis showed that SWCNTs induced a gene expression signature characteristic of DISEASE_D012769_heat_shock protein 90 (GENE_3320_HSP90) inhibition in MRC-5 cells, suggesting that SWCNTs may inhibit the GENE_3320_HSP90 signaling pathway.
28673683	Indeed, exposure of MRC-5 cells to SWCNTs results in a dose-dependent decrease in GENE_3320_HSP90 client proteins (AKT, GENE_1019_CDK4 and GENE_596_BCL2) and a concomitant increase in GENE_3308_HSP70 expression.
28673683	In addition, SWCNTs also significantly inhibited GENE_3320_HSP90-dependent protein refolding.
28673683	Finally, we showed that ectopic expression of GENE_3320_HSP90, but not GENE_171221_HSP40 or GENE_3308_HSP70, completely abrogated the cytotoxic effects of SWCNTs, suggesting that SWCNT-induced cellular DISEASE_D064420_toxicity is GENE_3320_HSP90 dependent.
28673683	In summary, our findings suggest that the toxic effects of SWCNTs are mediated through inhibition of GENE_3320_HSP90 in SPECIES_9606_human lung fibroblasts and keratinocytes.
28673684	The effect of GENE_10090)_fibroblast_growth_factor_15 deficiency on the development of high fat diet induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
28673684	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis often associated with metabolic syndrome.
28673684	GENE_10090)_Fibroblast_growth_factor_15 (GENE_10090)_FGF15), an endocrine factor mainly produced in the distal part of small intestine, has emerged to be a critical factor in regulating CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acid homeostasis, energy metabolism, and liver regeneration.
28673684	We hypothesized that GENE_10090)_FGF15 alters the development of each of the listed features of NASH.
28673684	To test this hypothesis, four-week old male GENE_10090)_Fgf15-/- and their corresponding wild-type (WT) SPECIES_10090_mice were fed either a high fat diet (HFD) or a control chow diet for six months.
28673684	The results confirmed that HFD feeding for six months in WT SPECIES_10090_mice recapitulated SPECIES_9606_human NASH phenotype, including macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.
28673684	Whereas GENE_10090)_FGF15 deficiency had no effect on the severity of liver steatosis or inflammation, it was associated with decreased liver fibrosis.
28673684	Furthermore, GENE_10090)_FGF15 deficiency resulted in abnormal CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acid homeostasis, increased insulin resistance, increased HFD-induced serum CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides, decreased inductions of hepatic CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol content by HFD, and altered gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes.
28673684	These data suggest that GENE_10090)_FGF15 improves lipid homeostasis and reduces CHEMICAL_D001647_bile_acid synthesis, but promotes fibrosis during the development of NASH.
28678435	Molecular mechanisms of action of CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene toxicity in blood plasma and liver.
28678435	CHEMICAL_D020058_Styrene is an aromatic colorless CHEMICAL_24632_hydrocarbon available in liquid form and highly volatile.
28678435	In its pure form, it gives a sweet smell.
28678435	The primary source of exposure in the environment is from plastic materials, rubber industries, packaging materials, insulations, and fiber glass and carpet industry.
28678435	Natural sources of CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene include: few metabolites in plants which are transferred through food chain.
28678435	The current study was designed to evaluate CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene toxicity, including: CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (SOD) and protein CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl, oxidative stress, GENE_10116)_glucose_6_phosphatase (GENE_10116)_G6Pase), GENE_10116)_glycogen_phosphorylase (GENE_10116)_GP), and CHEMICAL_D010728_phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GENE_10116)_PEPCK) activities, CHEMICAL_D000255_adenosine_triphosphate (CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP) to CHEMICAL_D000244_adenosine_diphosphate (CHEMICAL_D000244_ADP) ratio, and changes in gene expressions such as CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GENE_10116)_GLUD1), CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporter 2 (GENE_10116)_GLUT2), and GENE_10116)_glucokinase (GENE_10116)_GCK) in the SPECIES_10116_rat liver tissue.
28678435	For this purpose, CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene was dissolved in SPECIES_381124_corn oil and was administered via gavage, at doses 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, mg/kg/day per mL and control (SPECIES_381124_corn oil) to each SPECIES_10116_rat with one day off in a week, for 42 days.
28678435	Plasma SOD and protein CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl of plasma were significantly up-regulated in 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/kg/day CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene administrated groups (P   <   .001).
28678435	In addition, CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene caused an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) in the dose-dependent manners in liver tissue (P   <   .001).
28678435	Furthermore, the CHEMICAL__ferrous reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and total CHEMICAL_29256_thiol molecules (TTM) in CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene-treated groups were significantly decreased in liver tissue (P   <   .001) with increasing doses.
28678435	In treated SPECIES_10116_rats, CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene significantly increased GENE_10116)_G6Pase activity (P   <   .001) and down-regulated GENE_10116)_GP activity (P   <   .001) as compared to the control group.
28678435	The GENE_10116)_PEPCK activity was significantly raised in a dose-dependent manner (P   <   .001).
28678435	The CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP/CHEMICAL_D000244_ADP ratio of live cells was significantly raised by increasing the dose (P   <   .001).
28678435	There was significantly an up-regulation of GENE_10116)_GLUD1 and GENE_10116)_GCK at 2000 mg/kg group (P   <   .01) and a down-regulation for GENE_10116)_GLUT2 at the same dose.
28678435	While in the rest of group, GENE_10116)_GLUT2 showed up-regulation of relative fold change.
28678435	By targeting genes such as GENE_10116)_GLUD1, GENE_10116)_GLUT2, and GENE_10116)_GCK, disruption of hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and insulin secretory functions are obvious.
28678435	The present study illustrates that induction of oxidative stress followed by changes in GENE_10116)_G6Pase, GENE_10116)_GP, and GENE_10116)_PEPCK activities and the genes responsible for CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose metabolism are the mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D020058_styrene's action in the liver.
28682524	Restorative effects of CHEMICAL_C043561_Chrysin pretreatment on oxidant-antioxidant status, DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory cytokine production, and apoptotic and autophagic markers in acute CHEMICAL_D000082_paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in SPECIES_10116_rats: An experimental and biochemical study.
28682524	CHEMICAL_D000082_Paracetamol (PC) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug, but it leads to acute hepatotoxicity at high doses intakes.
28682524	This study was aimed to investigate the effects of CHEMICAL_C043561_Chrysin (CR) on hepatotoxicity constituted at high doses of PC in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28682524	SPECIES_10116_Rats were subjected to oral pretreatment of CR (25 and 50  mg/kg b.w.)
28682524	via feeding needle for 6 days against hepatotoxicity induced by a single dose of PC (500  mg/kg b.w.)
28682524	administered orally via feeding needles.
28682524	Although PC increases lipid peroxidation and liver enzyme activities, it has led to reduction of antioxidant enzyme activities.
28682524	PC induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammatory responses by increasing the levels of GENE_10116)_TNF_a and GENE_10116)_IL_1b.
28682524	Furthermore, PC caused apoptosis and autophagy by increasing activity of GENE_10116)_Caspase_3 and LC3B level.
28682524	On the other hand, CR therapy significantly regulated these values in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28682524	This study demonstrated that CR possesses restorative effect against PC-induced hepatotoxicity by suppressing oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and apoptotic and autophagic tissue damage.
28684144	CHEMICAL_C016101_Shikonin suppresses proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest through the inhibition of DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia-inducible factor-1a signaling.
28684144	DISEASE_D000860_Hypoxia enhances the development of DISEASE_D009369_solid_tumors.
28684144	DISEASE_D000860_Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor that is dominantly expressed under DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia in DISEASE_D009369_solid_tumor cells and is a key factor of DISEASE_D009369_tumor regulation.
28684144	HIF-1a regulates several target genes involved in many aspects of DISEASE_D009369_cancer progression, including angiogenesis, DISEASE_D009362_metastasis, and cell proliferation, as well as imparting resistance to DISEASE_D009369_cancer treatment.
28684144	In this study, we assessed CHEMICAL_C016101_shikonin, which derives from the traditional medical herb Lithospermum erythrorhizon, for its anti-DISEASE_D009369_cancer effects in DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia-induced human DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer cell lines.
28684144	CHEMICAL_C016101_Shikonin showed potent inhibitory activity against DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia-induced HIF-1a activation in various human DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell lines and efficient scavenging activity of DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia-induced reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species in DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells.
28684144	Further analysis revealed that CHEMICAL_C016101_shikonin inhibited HIF-1a protein synthesis without affecting the expression of HIF-1a mRNA or degrading HIF-1a protein.
28684144	It was subsequently shown to attenuate the activation of downstream mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1/eIF4E kinase.
28684144	CHEMICAL_C016101_Shikonin also dose-dependently caused the cell cycle arrest of activated HCT116  cells and inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 and SW620  cells.
28684144	Moreover, it significantly inhibited DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth in a xenograft modal.
28684144	These findings suggest that CHEMICAL_C016101_shikonin could be considered for use as a potential drug in human DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer therapy.
28687253	GENE_100128922_Connexin hemichannel inhibition reduces CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28687253	Historically, GENE_100128922_connexin hemichannels have been considered as structural precursors of gap junctions.
28687253	However, accumulating evidence points to independent roles for GENE_100128922_connexin hemichannels in cellular signaling by connecting the intracellular compartment with the extracellular environment.
28687253	Unlike gap junctions, GENE_100128922_connexin hemichannels seem to be mainly activated in pathological processes.
28687253	The present study was set up to test the potential involvement of hemichannels composed of GENE_2705_connexin32 and GENE_2697_connexin43 in acute hepatotoxicity induced by CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen.
28687253	Prior to this, in vitro testing was performed to confirm the specificity and efficacy of TAT-Gap24 and TAT-Gap19 in blocking GENE_2705_connexin32 and GENE_2697_connexin43 hemichannels, respectively.
28687253	Subsequently, SPECIES_10090_mice were overdosed with CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen followed by treatment with TAT-Gap24 or TAT-Gap19 or a combination of both after 1.5h.
28687253	Sampling was performed 3, 6, 24 and 48h following CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen administration.
28687253	Evaluation of the effects of GENE_100128922_connexin hemichannel inhibition was based on a series of clinically relevant read-outs, measurement of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.
28687253	Subsequent treatment of CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen-overdosed SPECIES_10090_mice with TAT-Gap19 only marginally affected DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury.
28687253	In contrast, a significant reduction in serum CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine aminotransferase activity was found upon administration of TAT-Gap24 to intoxicated animals.
28687253	Furthermore, co-treatment of CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen-overdosed SPECIES_10090_mice with both peptides revealed an additive effect as even lower serum CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine aminotransferase activity was observed.
28687253	Blocking of GENE_2705_connexin32 or GENE_2697_connexin43 hemichannels individually was found to decrease serum quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while no effects were observed on the occurrence of hepatic oxidative stress.
28687253	This study shows for the first time a role for GENE_100128922_connexin hemichannels in CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen-induced DISEASE_D017114_acute_liver_failure.
28688942	CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin, a natural CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid, intercalates with genomic DNA and exhibits protective effects in IL-1b stimulated DISEASE_D010003_osteoarthritis chondrocytes.
28688942	CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin has recently been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties and is of considerable interest due to its broad pharmacological activities.
28688942	The present study highlights that CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin binds DNA and exerts chondroprotective effects in  vitro.
28688942	CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin showed strong binding with chondrocytes genomic DNA in  vitro.
28688942	The mode of binding of CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin to genomic-DNA was assessed by competing CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin with CHEMICAL_4883_EtBr or CHEMICAL_C007293_DAPI, known DNA intercalator and a minor groove binder, respectively.
28688942	CHEMICAL_4883_EtBr fluorescence reduced significantly with increase in CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin concentration suggesting possible DNA intercalation of CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin.
28688942	Further, in silico molecular docking of CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin on mammalian DNA also indicated possible intercalation of CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin with DNA.
28688942	The denaturation and FRET studies revealed that CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin prevents denaturation of DNA strands and provide stability to genomic DNA against a variety of chemical denaturants.
28688942	The cellular uptake study showed that CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin enters DISEASE_D010003_osteoarthritis chondrocytes and was mainly localized in the nucleus.
28688942	CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin treatment to DISEASE_D010003_OA chondrocytes protects the fragmentation of genomic DNA in response to IL-1b as evaluated by DNA ladder and TUNEL assay.
28688942	Treatment of chondrocytes with CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin resulted in significant suppression of IL-1b-mediated induction of ROS.
28688942	Further, CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin exhibited protective potential through potent suppression of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and induction of anti-apoptotic proteins in IL-1b-stimulated DISEASE_D010003_osteoarthritis chondrocytes.
28688942	Our data thus suggest that DNA intercalation by CHEMICAL_C085514_Wogonin may result in the stabilization of genomic DNA leading to protective activity.
28688903	Differential effects between developmental and postpubertal exposure to CHEMICAL_D008770_N_methyl_N_nitrosourea on progenitor cell proliferation of SPECIES_10116_rat hippocampal neurogenesis in relation to GENE_10116)_COX2 expression in granule cells.
28688903	This study was performed to compare the exposure effects of CHEMICAL_D008770_N_methyl_N_nitrosourea (CHEMICAL_50102_MNU), a cytocidal agent of proliferating cells, on SPECIES_10116_rat hippocampal neurogenesis between developmental and postpubertal periods.
28688903	Developmental exposure through maternal drinking water from gestational day 6 to day 21 after delivery on weaning decreased GENE_2670_GFAP-immunoreactive (+) stem cells and increased immunoreactive cells indicative of subsequent progenitor and postmitotic immature neuronal populations, TUNEL+ or GENE_1026_p21Cip1/GENE_1026_Waf1+ stem/progenitor cells and GENE_4513_COX2+ granule cells, on postnatal day (PND) 21.
28688903	On PND 77 after cessation of developmental exposure, GENE_146713_NeuN+ postmitotic granule cells decreased in number.
28688903	Postpubertal exposure by oral gavage for 28days decreased the numbers of all granule cell lineage populations and ARC+ or GENE_4513_COX2+ granule cells and increased the number of TUNEL+ stem/progenitor cells.
28688903	These results suggested that both developmental and postpubertal exposure caused apoptosis of stem/progenitor cells.
28688903	However, developmental exposure increased GENE_4513_COX2 expression to facilitate intermediate progenitor cell proliferation and increased neuronal plasticity.
28688903	This effect was concurrent with the induction of GENE_1026_p21Cip1/GENE_1026_Waf1 that causes cell cycle arrest of stem/progenitor cells in response to accumulating DNA damage on weaning, resulting in a subsequent reduction of postmitotic granule cells.
28688903	In contrast, postpubertal exposure suppressed neuronal plasticity as evidenced by downregulation of ARC and GENE_4513_COX2.
28688903	The GENE_4513_COX2 downregulation was responsible for the lack of facilitating stem/progenitor cell proliferation.
28688903	Induction of apoptosis and the lack of cell proliferation facilitation may be responsible for the overall reduction of neurogenesis caused by postpubertal exposure.
28688903	Thus, the disrupted pattern of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by CHEMICAL_50102_MNU is different between developmental and postpubertal exposure.
28689058	Protective effect of CHEMICAL_C029036_crocin on CHEMICAL__BPA-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_toxicity in SPECIES_10116_rats through inhibition of oxidative stress and downregulation of MAPK and MAPKAP signaling pathway and miRNA-122 expression.
28689058	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is an artificial environmental endocrine disrupting chemical and commonly used as a monomer of CHEMICAL_61433_polycarbonate plastics and CHEMICAL_30721_epoxy resins.
28689058	The aim of the present study is to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of CHEMICAL_C029036_crocin, a constituent of saffron, against CHEMICAL__BPA-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_toxicity.
28689058	We showed that treatment of male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats with 0.5  mg/kg CHEMICAL__BPA for 30 days increased the level of CHEMICAL_C075750_8_isoprostane, decreased the level of reduced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione, elevated serum levels of CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate aminotransferase, CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase, CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride, and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, and induced DISEASE_D007249_periportal_inflammation.
28689058	Western blot results revealed that CHEMICAL__BPA increased the phosphorylation of GENE_10116)_c_Jun_N_terminal_kinase (GENE_10116)_JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (GENE_50689;116590_ERK1_2), and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK), but not GENE_10116)_p38.
28689058	CHEMICAL__BPA also reduced the GENE_10116)_Akt signaling activation and upregulated microRNA (GENE_10116)_miR_122) expression.
28689058	Moreover, we showed here that CHEMICAL_C029036_crocin 20  mg/kg administration ameliorated DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage and improved elevated levels of TG and liver enzymes of CHEMICAL__BPA-treated SPECIES_10116_rats possibly though antioxidant activity, downregulation of GENE_10116)_miR_122 transcript level and lowering the phosphorylation of GENE_10116)_JNK, GENE_50689;116590_ERK1_2, and MAPKAPK and subsequently their activities.
28689058	Overall, the findings suggest that CHEMICAL_C029036_crocin possesses hepatoprotective effects against CHEMICAL__BPA-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_toxicity by enhancing the antioxidative defense system and regulation of important signaling pathway activities and GENE_10116)_miR_122 expression.
28693884	The CHEMICAL__flavonoid_rutin modulates microglial/macrophage activation to a GENE_6504_CD150/GENE_4360_CD206 M2 phenotype.
28693884	CHEMICAL_D012431_Rutin is a glycosylated CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid present in many fruits and plants that has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
28693884	However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying microglial activation and its effects on the regulation of cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammatory responses in the central nervous system.
28693884	In this study we examined the effect of CHEMICAL_D012431_rutin on resting or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia and characterized their modulation to an activated M1 phenotype or an alternatively activated M2 phenotype.
28693884	Microglial cells were treated with CHEMICAL_D012431_rutin (1-100   M); alternatively, microglial cells were stimulated with LPS and the cells were then treated with CHEMICAL_D012431_rutin (50   M).
28693884	The results revealed that CHEMICAL_D012431_rutin treatment was not toxic to microglial cells and induced a dose-dependent increase in microglial proliferation associated with changes in morphology after 24  h of treatment.
28693884	CHEMICAL_D012431_Rutin also induced microglial activation characterized by an increase in OX-42 positive cells and a large proportion of cells with a GENE_6504_CD150/GENE_4360_CD206-positive M2 phenotype.
28693884	CHEMICAL_D012431_Rutin also induced a decrease in the mRNA levels of GENE_7124_TNF, GENE_3553_IL1b, GENE_3569_IL6 and iNOS, reduced the production of GENE_3569_IL6, GENE_7124_TNF, and CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide, and increased production of the M2 regulatory cytokine GENE_3586_IL10 and arginase.
28693884	CHEMICAL_D012431_Rutin also significantly inhibited the LPS-induced expression of GENE_5743_PTGS2, GENE_3606_IL18 and GENE_7040_TGFb mRNA.
28693884	These findings show that CHEMICAL_D012431_rutin has the ability to promote microglial proliferation and induces microglial polarization to the M2 profile when cells are stimulated with LPS.
28693884	These results point this CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid as a possible alternative in the treatment or prevention of DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disorders.
28689802	Comparison of phenotypic and global gene expression changes in SPECIES_8364_Xenopus_tropicalis embryos induced by agonists of GENE_8364)_RAR and RXR.
28689802	CHEMICAL_D014212_Retinoic_acid functions through two classes of receptors, i.e., the GENE_8364)_retinoic_acid_receptor (GENE_8364)_RAR) and the CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid X receptor (RXR).
28689802	The difference in the role between GENE_8364)_RAR and RXR, however, are not well clarified.
28689802	In the present study, we comparatively investigated the phenotypic and global gene expression changes in SPECIES_8364_Xenopus_tropicalis embryos induced by three different agonists, including a GENE_8364)_RAR selective ligand (CHEMICAL_D014212_all_trans_retinoic_acid, CHEMICAL__at_RA), a RXR selective ligand (CHEMICAL__fluorobexarotene, CHEMICAL__FBA) and their common ligand (9-cis CHEMICAL_D014212_retinoic_acid, CHEMICAL__9c_RA).
28689802	All three agonists induced striking and similar malformations in SPECIES_8364_X_tropicalis embryos at the concentrations of 5-50 g/L.
28689802	Especially, the development of anterior structures and caudal region was dramatically altered.
28689802	The hierarchical clustering analysis of phenotypes and gene profiles suggested that effects induced by CHEMICAL__9c_RA separated from those by at-RA and CHEMICAL__FBA.
28689802	The up-regulated genes were involved in multiple pathways while down-regulated genes were mainly related to phototransduction and CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine metabolism.
28689802	at-RA primarily affected the CHEMICAL_D014801_retinol, glycolysis, starch and CHEMICAL_D013395_sucrose metabolisms while CHEMICAL__FBA led to disturbances in more wide-ranging pathways such as the PPAR, adipocytokine, insulin, FoxO signaling pathways, CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine, CHEMICAL_D001224_aspartate and CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate metabolism.
28689802	RXR is a heterodimeric partner for several other nuclear receptors, which opens the possibility that additional CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid effects could be mediated by CHEMICAL__FBA, such as RXR-PPAR.
28689802	Our data indicates that not only RXR-GENE_8364)_RAR but also RXR-PPAR plays important roles in the control of metabolism with CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid treatment in SPECIES_8364_X_tropicalis embryos.
28689916	Molecular mechanism of anti-cancerous potential of Morin extracted from mulberry in Hela cells.
28689916	The CHEMICAL_D005419_flavonoids are of great interest due to their antioxidant and anti-cancerous potential.
28689916	The present study investigated the Morin extracted from mulberry leaves and its anti-cancerous mechanism via cell inhibition, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis, mRNA expression and antioxidant mechanism through reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species generation.
28689916	Morin inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells at IC50 of 214.28   M and led to morphological changes, followed by induction of cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase and ultimately resulted into apoptosis.
28689916	Morin-induced G2/M-phase arrest was accompanied by the increase in mRNA expression of GENE_7157_p53, GENE_644914_p21 and GENE_7465_Wee_1 genes and decreased levels of GENE_983_CDK1, GENE_995_Cdc25c, Survivin, GENE_891_cyclin_B1and GENE_11200_CHK2.
28689916	Morin-induced apoptosis was regulated through multiple pathways, including intrinsic and extrinsic pathway.
28689916	The underlying mechanisms consisted of increased mRNA expression of GENE_581_Bax, GENE_572_Bad, GENE_54205_cytochrome_c, GENE_317_Apaf_1, caspases-9, GENE_8718_DR3, GENE_8795_DR5, GENE_356_FasL, GENE_8772_FADD, caspases-10, GENE_1302_PARP, PI3K, GENE_207_AKT, GENE_2475_mTOR, GENE_6198_P70S6K and Smac genes as well as decreased expression of GENE_596_Bcl_2, GENE_598_Bcl_xL, AMPK, GENE_329_cIAP_1, GENE_330_cIAP_2, DISEASE_C566847_PKC   and NF-kb.
28689916	In addition, Morin treatment resulted in the generation of intracellular ROS, which play an essential role in the induction of apoptosis.
28689916	The present study recommends the use of Morin in the development of functional foods with anti-cancerous potential in the future.
28694203	GENE_10090)_Soluble_epoxide_hydrolase inhibitor CHEMICAL__AUDA decreases CHEMICAL_D001761_bleomycin-induced DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_toxicity in SPECIES_10090_mice by inhibiting the GENE_10090)_p38/GENE_10090)_Smad3 pathways.
28694203	CHEMICAL_D001761_Bleomycin (CHEMICAL__BLM) has potent DISEASE_D009369_tumor cell-killing properties that have given it an important place in DISEASE_D009369_cancer chemotherapy, but DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_toxicity is its major adverse effect.
28694203	GENE_2053_Soluble_epoxide_hydrolase (GENE_2053_sEH) inhibitors have been reported to have protective effects in DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis models, but the effects of CHEMICAL__AUDA, an GENE_2053_sEH inhibitor of CHEMICAL__BLM-induced DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_toxicity and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis, remain to be researched.
28694203	In this study, we assessed the effects of CHEMICAL__AUDA on the CHEMICAL__BLM-induced DISEASE_D011658_pulmonary_fibrosis in a SPECIES_10090_mouse model, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1-induced epithelial proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro by monitoring changes in pulmonary function, inflammatory response, DISEASE_D020257_fibrotic_remodeling, and signaling pathways.
28694203	CHEMICAL__AUDA was administered by intragastric administration (i.g) daily for three weeks, starting at seven days after intratracheal instillation of CHEMICAL__BLM.
28694203	All examinations were performed 24h after the last i.g.
28694203	In vivo, CHEMICAL__AUDA significantly improved CHEMICAL__BLM-induced DISEASE_D008171_decline_in_lung_function and body weight, and inhibited inflammatory cell accumulation and the mRNA and protein expression of GENE_3553_interleukin_IL_1b, GENE_7040_TGF_b1, and GENE_4318_matrix_metalloproteinase_9 (GENE_4318_MMP_9) in lung tissue.
28694203	Moreover, CHEMICAL__AUDA attenuated CHEMICAL__BLM-induced deposition of collagen fibers, destruction of DISEASE_D028361_alveolar_structures, and DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_parenchyma.
28694203	Additionally, CHEMICAL__AUDA regulated the expression of GENE_58_a_smooth_muscle_actin (a-GENE_6606_SMA) and GENE_999_E_cadherin by inhibiting the GENE_4088_Smad3/GENE_1432_p38 signaling pathway.
28694203	In vitro, CHEMICAL__AUDA significantly inhibited GENE_7040_TGF_b1-induced epithelial cells and fibroblast proliferation, reduced GENE_2053_sEH expression and GENE_58_a_SMA expression, and increased CHEMICAL_64007_epoxyeicosatrienoic_acid (CHEMICAL_64007_EET) levels and GENE_999_E_cadherin expression in epithelial cells.
28694203	These effects were blocked by CHEMICAL__AUDA by downregulating the GENE_4088_Smad3 and GENE_1432_p38 signaling pathways.
28694203	Taken together, these data indicate that treatment with GENE_2053_sEH inhibitors may improve CHEMICAL__BLM-induced DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_toxicity.

28692354	CONTEXT: CHEMICAL_D011134_Polysaccharides (CHEMICAL_53277_PSs) from seaweeds have been reported to possess biological activity of potential medicinal values.
28692354	OBJECTIVE: The current study was conducted to establish the protective effects of PS extracted from Ulva lactuca against oxidative stress induced by CHEMICAL_C417209_Thiacloprid (CHEMICAL_D013759_THC) in the rat reproductive system.
28692354	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were exposed either to CHEMICAL_D013759_THC, CHEMICAL_D013759_THC   +   PS (100   mg/kg), or CHEMICAL_D013759_THC   +   CHEMICAL__PS (200   mg/kg).
28692354	RESULTS: Our study showed that CHEMICAL_D013759_THC induced DISEASE_D001523_severe_disorders in the functional sperm parameters.
28692354	A decrease in antioxidant activities and their genes expression were observed in the same group, compared to the controls.
28692354	Our molecular data showing also a severe DNA breakdown in the testis of CHEMICAL_D013759_THC treated group.
28692354	Moreover, CHEMICAL_D013759_THC treated group showed severe histopathological changes.
28692354	CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that PS extracted from Ulva lactuca alleviated the CHEMICAL_D013759_THC induced reprotoxicity and reduced oxidative stress damages, DNA breakdown and histological injuries in the testis.
28697429	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A disrupts steroidogenesis and induces a sex hormone imbalance through GENE_10090)_c_Jun phosphorylation in Leydig cells.
28697429	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a well-known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) that is used to manufacture plastic consumer products.
28697429	It is well known that exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA can induce defects in gonad development and negatively influences reproductive function in both males and females.
28697429	In this study, we assessed the effects of CHEMICAL__BPA on hormone production in Leydig cells, which secrete hormones in the testes and support male fertility.
28697429	We examined two steroidogenic enzymes, GENE_10090)_CYP11A1 and GENE_10090)_CYP19 that involved in sex hormone synthesis in SPECIES_10090_mouse MA-10 Leydig cells.
28697429	We found that CHEMICAL__BPA activated GENE_10090)_CYP gene in both mRNA and protein levels then resulted in alteration of the normal sex hormone ratio.
28697429	Furthermore, we found that CHEMICAL__BPA induced GENE_10090)_c_Jun phosphorylation and contributed to GENE_10090)_CYP gene expression.
28697429	Similar results were observed in an animal study.
28697429	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__BPA disrupts the hormone environment in testis via steroidogenic gene activation through the JNK/GENE_10090)_c_Jun signaling pathway.
28698096	Differential pulmonary effects of wintertime DISEASE_D004670_California_and_China_particulate matter in healthy young SPECIES_10090_mice.
28698096	Airborne particulate matter (PM) is associated with adverse cardiorespiratory effects.
28698096	To better understand source-orientated PM DISEASE_D064420_toxicity, a comparative study of the biological effects of fine PM (diameter<= 2.5 m, PM2.5) collected during the winter season from Shanxi Province, China, and the Central Valley, California, United States, was conducted.
28698096	The overarching hypothesis for this study was to test whether the chemical composition of PM on an equal mass basis from two urban areas, one in China and one in California, can lead to significantly different effects of acute DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in the lungs of healthy young SPECIES_10090_mice.
28698096	Male, 8-week old BALB/C SPECIES_10090_mice received a single 50 g dose of vehicle, Taiyuan PM or Sacramento PM by oropharyngeal aspiration and were sacrificed 24h later.
28698096	Bronchoalveolar lavage, ELISA and histopathology were performed along with chemical analysis of PM composition.
28698096	Sacramento PM had a greater proportion of oxidized organic material, significantly increased neutrophil numbers and elevated GENE_10090)_CXCL_1 and GENE_10090)_TNF_a protein levels compared to the Taiyuan PM.
28698096	The findings suggest that Sacramento PM2.5 was associated with a greater inflammatory response compared to that of Taiyuan PM2.5 that may be due to a higher oxidice.
28698096	Male, 8-week old BALB/C SPECIES_10090_mice received a single 50 g dose of vehicle, Taiyuan PM or Sacramento PM by oropharyngeal aspiration and were sacrificed 24h later.
28698096	Bronchoalveolar lavage, ELISA and histopathology were performed along with chemical analysis of PM composition.
28698096	Sacramento PM had a greater proportion of oxidized organic material, significantly increased neutrophil numbers and elevated GENE_10090)_CXCL_1 and GENE_10090)_TNF_a protein levels compared to the Taiyuan PM.
28698096	The findings suggest that Sacramento PM2.5 was associated with a greater inflammatory response compared to that of Taiyuan PM2.5 that may be due to a higher oxidized state of organic CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon and CHEMICAL_D003300_copper content.
28698385	CHEMICAL_D014212_Retinoic_acid GENE_10090)_receptor_related_orphan_receptor_a stimulates adipose tissue DISEASE_D007249_inflammation by modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress.
28698385	Adipose tissue DISEASE_D007249_inflammation has been linked to DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_diseases such as DISEASE_D009765_obesity and DISEASE_D017827_type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes.
28698385	However, the molecules that mediate DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in adipose tissue have not been addressed.
28698385	Although CHEMICAL_D014212_retinoic_acid GENE_10090)_receptor_related_orphan_receptor_a (GENE_10090)_RORa) is known to be involved in the regulation of inflammatory response in some tissues, its role is largely unknown in adipose tissue.
28698385	Conversely, it is known that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolding protein response (UPR) signaling affect the inflammatory response in DISEASE_D009765_obese adipose tissue, but whether GENE_10090)_RORa regulates these processes remains unknown.
28698385	In this study, we investigate the link between GENE_10090)_RORa and adipose tissue DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28698385	We showed that the inflammatory response in macrophages or 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, as well as adipose tissue in DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10090_mice, markedly increased the expression of GENE_10090)_RORa.
28698385	SPECIES_10535_Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GENE_10090)_RORa or treatment with the GENE_10090)_RORa-specific agonist CHEMICAL_C559087_SR1078 enhanced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and increased the number of infiltrated macrophages into adipose tissue.
28698385	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C559087_SR1078 up-regulated the mRNA expression of ER stress response genes and enhanced phosphorylations of two of the three mediators of major UPR signaling pathways, GENE_10090)_PERK and GENE_10090)_IRE1a.
28698385	Finally, we found that alleviation of ER stress using a chemical chaperone followed by the suppression of GENE_10090)_RORa induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in adipose tissue.
28698385	Our data suggest that GENE_10090)_RORa-induced ER stress response potentially contributes to the adipose tissue DISEASE_D007249_inflammation that can be mitigated by treatment with chemical chaperones.
28698385	The relationships established here between GENE_10090)_RORa expression, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and UPR signaling may have implications for therapeutic targeting of DISEASE_D009765_obesity-related DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_diseases.
28700904	Inhibition of high CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis by a novel CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin derivative prevents renal and DISEASE_D006335_heart_injury in DISEASE_D003920_diabetic mice.
28700904	DISEASE_D006943_Hyperglycemia-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis have important roles in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D003928_diabetic_nephropathy and DISEASE_D009202_cardiomyopathy.
28700904	With inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways as important mediators, targeting DISEASE_D007249_inflammation may be an effective approach to new avenue for treating DISEASE_D048909_diabetic_complications.
28700904	J17, a molecule with structural similarities to CHEMICAL_D003474_curcumin, exhibited good anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages.
28700904	However, its ability to alleviate DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia-induced injury via its anti-inflammatory actions remained unclear.
28700904	Thus, we reported that J17 exerts significant inhibitory effects on DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis in NRK-52E cells, H9C2 cells and a CHEMICAL_D013311_streptozotocin-induced DISEASE_D003920_diabetic_mouse model.
28700904	We also found that the anti-inflammatory and anti-DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis activities of J17 are associated with the inhibition of the P38 and AKT signal pathway, respectively.
28700904	In vivo oral administration of J17 suppressed DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis, thereby reducing key markers for DISEASE_D006331_renal_and_cardiac_dysfunction and improving in DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis and pathological changes in both renal and cardiac tissues of DISEASE_D003920_diabetic mice.
28700904	The results of this study indicated that J17 can be potentially used as a cardio- and reno-protective agent and that targeting the P38 and AKT pathways may be an effective therapeutic strategy for DISEASE_D048909_diabetic_complications.
28700905	DISEASE_D019190_Chronic_iron_overload induces functional and structural vascular changes in small resistance arteries via CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase-dependent CHEMICAL_D013481_O2_ production.
28700905	CHEMICAL_D007501_Iron overload leads to excessive free radical formation and induces DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_dysfunction.
28700905	Thus, our aim was to investigate the structural and endothelial modulation of vascular tone induced by chronic CHEMICAL_D007501_iron overload in mesenteric arteries.
28700905	SPECIES_10116_Rats were divided into two groups: the control (vehicle) group and the group treated with CHEMICAL__iron_dextran for 28days (100mg/kg, 5days a week).
28700905	DISEASE_D019190_Chronic_iron_overload altered the following morpho-physiological parameters of third-order mesenteric resistance arteries: decreased lumen and external diameters; increased wall/lumen ratio and wall thickness; decreased distensibility and increased stiffness; and increased pulse wave velocity.
28700905	Additionally, CHEMICAL_D007501_iron overload increased the vasoconstrictor response in mesenteric arterial rings in vitro but did not affect the relaxation induced by CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine and CHEMICAL_D009599_sodium_nitroprusside.
28700905	It is suggested that CHEMICAL_D007501_iron overload reduces CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide bioavailability by increasing free radicals, because CHEMICAL_D019331_L_NAME did not shift the concentration-response curve to CHEMICAL_D010656_phenylephrine, but CHEMICAL_D019331_L_NAME plus CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase shifted the curve to the left.
28700905	In vitro assays with DAF-2 and DHE indicated reduced NO production and increased CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide anion (CHEMICAL_D013481_O2_) generation in the CHEMICAL_D007501_iron-overloaded group.
28700905	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_D014013_tiron, GENE_10116)_catalase, apocynin and CHEMICAL_D019808_losartan induced reduced reactivity only in CHEMICAL_D007501_iron-overloaded SPECIES_10116_rats.
28700905	Moreover, increased ACE activity was observed in the mesenteric resistance arteries of CHEMICAL_D007501_iron-overloaded SPECIES_10116_rats accompanied by an increase in gp91phox, GENE_10116)_catalase, GENE_50689;116590_ERK1_2 and eNOS protein expression.
28700905	In conclusion, these findings show that chronic CHEMICAL_D007501_iron overload induces structural and functional changes in resistance arteries, most likely due to a decrease in NO bioavailability resulting from an increase in CHEMICAL_D013481_O2_ production by CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase.
28701262	Effects of low-dose CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A on CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium ion influx and on genes of proliferation and differentiation in immortalized SPECIES_9606_human gingival cells in vitro: The role of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor beta.
28701262	OBJECTIVES: Relating to low-dose CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), there is still a lack of mechanistic studies in oral cells, representing the first targets of CHEMICAL__BPA by oral intake.
28701262	The objective of this study was to investigate an assumed mechanistic interrelationship between both low-dose CHEMICAL__BPA-modulated CHEMICAL_D002118_Calcium ion (CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_) influx and cell behavior, and the GENE_2100_estrogen_receptor_b (GENE_2100_ERb), in oral mucosal cells.
28701262	METHODS: Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was conducted on GENE_2100_estrogen_receptor_beta (GENE_2100_ERb) activity after 1, 3, and 6days in response to 39nM CHEMICAL__BPA, 15 M CHEMICAL__BPA, and 200 pM CHEMICAL__17b_Estradiol (E2).
28701262	In addition to CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ concentration measurement, qPCR for proliferation and differentiation biomarkers was performed, to examine cell behavior.
28701262	Fulvestrant-mediated ER inhibition was employed to seek for a mechanistic role of GENE_2100_ERb in regulating CHEMICAL__BPA-emanating effects.
28701262	RESULTS: While both E2 and CHEMICAL__BPA yielded GENE_2100_ERb activation, 39nM CHEMICAL__BPA and 200 pM E2 did not change GENE_4288_MKI67 proliferation marker expression, but reduced transcription of differentiation markers.
28701262	Conversely, 15 M CHEMICAL__BPA reduced GENE_4288_MKI67 transcription, but significantly increased differentiation gene expression and intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ levels.
28701262	CHEMICAL_C070081_Fulvestrant-induced GENE_2100_ERb inhibition yielded complete elimination of all E2- and CHEMICAL__BPA-triggered modulatory effects, suggesting a mechanistic role of activated GENE_2100_ERb for CHEMICAL__BPA-mediated CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ influx and keratinocyte differentiation.
28701262	SIGNIFICANCE: Concerning cell behavior, these findings provide significant evidence of a threshold-dependent transcription of proliferation and differentiation-related genes as well as CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ influx in response to 39nM and 15 M low-dose CHEMICAL__BPA, which identify a mechanistic role of activated GENE_2100_ERb in oral keratinocytes.
28705778	Maternal CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron exposure alters testicular development in SPECIES_9606_male offspring SPECIES_10116_rats at the whole genome level.
28705778	CHEMICAL_D008044_Linuron is a widely used herbicide; its DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on the SPECIES_9606_male reproductive system has been recognized.
28705778	The current study was designed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron-induced reproductive DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28705778	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_rats received daily oral gavage of CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron at the dose of 120mg/kg/d from gestation day (GD)12 to GD17.
28705778	Tissues from SPECIES_9606_male offspring SPECIES_10116_rats were collected for pathological examination and microarray gene expression profiling.
28705778	Changes in gene expression were further verified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
28705778	Data showed that CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron-exposed offspring SPECIES_10116_rats had a decreased sperm count (88% of controls) and disrupted acrosome formation.
28705778	There were evident damages in seminiferous tubules and abnormal morphology in mesenchymal cells in samples from CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron-exposed animals.
28705778	Microarray analysis indicated that the expressions of CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone synthesis-associated genes, i.e., Star, P450scc, 3b-Hsd, GENE_26_Abp, GENE_1347_Cox7a2, GENE_5111_Pcna, GENE_1586_p450c17and17b-Hsd were significantly altered by CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron exposure, along with other genes involving in cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as c-myc, PROTEINMUTATION_p|SUB|S|6|K_S6K, GENE_317_Apaf1, and GENE_7248_TSC1.
28705778	These data indicate that CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron upon entering SPECIES_9606_male offspring body can directly or indirectly interact with the CHEMICAL_50113_androgen production and function; CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron-induced alteration in genes encoding CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone synthesis is likely a major factor in CHEMICAL_D008044_linuron-induced DISEASE_D064420_male_reproductive_toxicity.
28707438	Long term impact of the endocrine disruptor CHEMICAL_C011559_tributyltin on male fertility following a single acute exposure.
28707438	Declining rate of SPECIES_9606_human fertility is a growing concern, where lifestyle and environmental factors play an important role.
28707438	We recently demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C011559_tributyltin (CHEMICAL_27086_TBT), an omnipresent endocrine disruptor, affects testicular cells in vitro.
28707438	In this study, male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were gavaged a single dose of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg CHEMICAL__TBT_chloride (CHEMICAL__TBTC) (to mimic accidental exposure in vivo) and sacrificed on day 3 and day 7, respectively.
28707438	CHEMICAL_27086_TBT bioavailability was evaluated by estimating total CHEMICAL_D014001_tin content, and essential metal levels were analyzed along with redox molecules (ROS and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH/CHEMICAL_D019803_GSSG) to understand the effect on physiological conditions.
28707438	Blood-testicular barrier (BTB) disruption, levels of associated proteins and activity of proteolytic enzymes were evaluated to understand the effect on BTB.
28707438	Histological analysis of tissue architecture and effect on protein expression of steroidogenic, stress and apoptotic markers were also evaluated.
28707438	Widespread CHEMICAL__TBTC pollution can be an eventual threat to male fertility worldwide.
28709031	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A induces GENE_4513_COX_2 through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and is associated with levels of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation-related markers in elderly populations.
28709031	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical, and it is one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide.
28709031	Even though several in vivo and in vitro studies showed positive associations of CHEMICAL__BPA exposure with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor-a and GENE_3569_interleukin_IL_6, the mechanism by which CHEMICAL__BPA induces DISEASE_D007249_inflammation is unclear.
28709031	We investigated the mechanism by which CHEMICAL__BPA induces DISEASE_D007249_inflammation (expression of DISEASE_D007249_inflammation-related genes, changes in oxidative stress, and cell proliferation and migration) and evaluated the effect of CHEMICAL__BPA exposure on DISEASE_D007249_inflammation-related markers in epidemiologic studies using repeat urine and serum samples from elderly subjects.
28709031	CHEMICAL__BPA induced GENE_4513_COX_2 expression via nuclear translocation of NF-kB and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by phosphorylation of GENE_5595;5594_ERK1_2 and enhanced the DISEASE_D008175_migration_of_lung_cancer A549 and DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer MDAMB-231 cells.
28709031	In two epidemiologic studies, we detected associations of CHEMICAL__BPA with six DISEASE_D007249_inflammation-related markers (WBC, CRP, GENE_3586_IL_10, ALT, AST, and y-CHEMICAL_D006160_GTP levels).
28709031	Our findings probably suggest that CHEMICAL__BPA exposure induces DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and exacerbates DISEASE_D063646_tumorigenesis.
28709945	CHEMICAL_C115642_Punicalagin, a CHEMICAL_26195_polyphenol from pomegranate fruit, induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D015324_PC_3_and_LNCaP cells.
28709945	DISEASE_D011471_Prostate_cancer (DISEASE_D015324_PCa) is an international health problem and search for its effective treatment is in progress.
28709945	Punicalagin (PN), CHEMICAL_26195_polyphenol from pomegranate fruit, is known to exhibit potent anticancer activity in lung, breast and cervical cells.
28709945	However, there is paucity of information on its effect in DISEASE_D015324_PCa.
28709945	This study evaluated anti-proliferative effects of PN and its effects on extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in DISEASE_D015324_PCa cells, and angiogenesis in SPECIES_9031_chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
28709945	Antioxidant activities of PN were determined by CHEMICAL__2_2_diphenyl_1_picryhydrazyl (CHEMICAL__DPPH) radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) methods.
28709945	DISEASE_D015324_PCa (GENE_57332_PC_3_and_LNCaP) and normal prostate (SPECIES_9606_BPH_1) cells were cultured and treated with PN (10, 50 and 100   M).
28709945	DISEASE_D064420_Cytotoxicity and viability effects of PN were determined by CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and XTT assays, respectively.
28709945	Antiangiogenic effects were measured using CAM assay, while apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation, enrichment factor by Cell Death Detection ELISA kit and expressions of GENE_836;841_caspases_3_and_8.
28709945	Results showed that PN (10-200   M) significantly scavenged CHEMICAL__DPPH and inhibited LPO in a concentration-dependent manner.
28709945	Furthermore, PN (10-100   M) concentration-dependently inhibited viability in GENE_57332_PC_3_and_LNCaP, while viability in BPH-1 was insignificantly affected.
28709945	PN had low DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on cells in  vitro at concentrations tested.
28709945	Also, PN (100   M) increased enrichment factor in GENE_57332_PC_3 (2.34      0.05) and LNCaP (2.31      0.26) relative to control (1.00      0.00).
28709945	In addition, PN (50   M) decreased the network of vessels in CAM, suggesting its anti-angiogenic effect.
28709945	Moreso, PN increased the expressions of GENE_836;841_caspases_3_and_8 in GENE_57332_PC_3.
28709945	Overall, PN exerts anti-proliferative activity in DISEASE_D015324_PCa cells via induction of apoptosis and anti-angiogenic effect.
28711525	Novel GENE_3320_Hsp90 inhibitor CHEMICAL_C108953_platycodin_D disrupts GENE_3320_Hsp90/GENE_11140_Cdc37 complex and enhances the anticancer effect of GENE_2475_mTOR inhibitor.
28711525	DISEASE_D012769_Heat_shock protein 90 (GENE_3320_Hsp90) is a critically conserved molecular chaperone protein and promising therapeutic target for DISEASE_D009369_cancer treatment.
28711525	In this study, CHEMICAL_C108953_platycodin_D (DISEASE_D003699_PD), a CHEMICAL_D012503_saponin isolated from traditional Chinese herb Platycodonis Radix, was identified as a novel GENE_3320_Hsp90 inhibitor.
28711525	We verified that DISEASE_D003699_PD did not affect the ATPase activity of GENE_3320_Hsp90.
28711525	However, DISEASE_D003699_PD disrupted the co-chaperone interaction of GENE_3320_Hsp90/cell division cycle protein 37 (GENE_11140_Cdc37) and subsequently degraded multiple GENE_3320_Hsp90 client proteins without the feedback increase of GENE_3308_Hsp70.
28711525	In different genotypes of DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer cells, co-treatment with the GENE_2475_mTOR inhibitor CHEMICAL_C107135_Everolimus and DISEASE_D003699_PD enhanced antiproliferation activity and apoptotic effect.
28711525	The feedback survival signal upon GENE_2475_mTOR inhibition was fully terminated by the co-administration with DISEASE_D003699_PD through reduced GENE_1956_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR) and GENE_3480_insulin_growth_factor_1_receptor (GENE_3480_IGF1R) expression, suppressed AKT activity, and reinforced GENE_1978_4E_BP1 inhibition.
28711525	Our results not only identified DISEASE_D003699_PD as a novel GENE_3320_Hsp90 inhibitor by disrupting the protein-protein interaction of GENE_3320_Hsp90/GENE_11140_Cdc37 complex, but also provided mechanistic insights into the ineffectiveness of GENE_2475_mTOR inhibitors and identified therapeutic strategy for DISEASE_D009369_cancer treatment.
28711546	Evaluation of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor alpha activation by CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-based herbicide constituents.
28711546	The safety, including the endocrine disruptive capability, of CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) is a matter of intense debate.
28711546	We evaluated the estrogenic potential of CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate, commercial GBHs and polyethoxylated CHEMICAL__tallowamine adjuvants present as co-formulants in GBHs.
28711546	CHEMICAL_C010974_Glyphosate (>= 10,000   g/L or 59   M) promoted proliferation of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-dependent MCF-7 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28711546	CHEMICAL_C010974_Glyphosate also increased the expression of an CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen response element-luciferase reporter gene (ERE-luc) in T47D-KBluc cells, which was blocked by the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen antagonist CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI_182_780.
28711546	Commercial GBH formulations or their adjuvants alone did not exhibit estrogenic effects in either assay.
28711546	Transcriptomics analysis of MCF-7  cells treated with CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate revealed changes in gene expression reflective of hormone-induced cell proliferation but did not overlap with an GENE_2099_ERa gene expression biomarker.
28711546	Calculation of CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate binding energy to GENE_2099_ERa predicts a weak and unstable interaction (-4.10  kcal  mol(-1)) compared to CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol (-25.79  kcal  mol(-1)), which suggests that activation of this receptor by CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate is via a ligand-independent mechanism.
28711546	Induction of ERE-luc expression by the PKA signalling activator IBMX shows that ERE-luc is responsive to ligand-independent activation, suggesting a possible mechanism of CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-mediated activation.
28711546	Our study reveals that CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate, but not other components present in GBHs, can activate GENE_2099_ERa in  vitro, albeit at relatively high concentrations.
28711657	CHEMICAL_C006552_Kaempferol impedes GENE_9235_IL_32-induced monocyte-macrophage differentiation.
28711657	CHEMICAL_C006552_Kaempferol possesses a wide range of therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties.
28711657	The present study sought to evaluate the effects and possible pharmacological mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C006552_kaempferol on interleukin (IL)-32-induced monocyte-macrophage differentiation.
28711657	In this study, we performed flow cytometry assay, immunocytochemical staining, quantitative real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay, GENE_834_caspase_1 assay, and Western blotting to observe the effects and underlying mechanisms of CHEMICAL_C006552_kaempferol using the SPECIES_9606_human monocyte cell line GENE_2736_THP_1.
28711657	The flow cytometry, immunocytochemical staining, and real-time PCR results show that CHEMICAL_C006552_kaempferol attenuated GENE_9235_IL_32-induced monocyte differentiation to product macrophage-like cells.
28711657	CHEMICAL_C006552_Kaempferol decreased the production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in this case thymic stromal lymphopoietin (GENE_85480_TSLP), GENE_3553_IL_1b, DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor (GENE_7124_TNF)-a, and GENE_3576_IL_8.
28711657	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C006552_kaempferol inhibited the GENE_9235_IL_32-induced activation of GENE_1432_p38 and nuclear factor-kB in a dose-dependent manner in GENE_2736_THP_1  cells.
28711657	CHEMICAL_C006552_Kaempferol also ameliorated the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the inflammatory mediators GENE_85480_TSLP, GENE_3553_IL_1b, GENE_7124_TNF_a, GENE_3576_IL_8, and CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide of macrophage-like cells differentiated by GENE_9235_IL_32.
28711657	In brief, our findings may provide new mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of CHEMICAL_C006552_kaempferol.
28710019	Effects of SPECIES_9606_human blood levels of two CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixtures on the GENE_196_AHR signalling activation pathway and GENE_1543_CYP1A1 and GENE_1312_COMT target genes in DISEASE_D006106_granulosa_non_tumor and granulosa DISEASE_D009369_tumor cell lines.
28710019	Epidemiological studies have shown a link between problems with offspring of couples living in a contaminated environment in comparison to those who live in an uncontaminated environment.
28710019	We measured the concentrations of 16 priority CHEMICAL_D011084_polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons (CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs) in maternal and cord blood.
28710019	To explore the mechanism of the effects of CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixtures on nonluteinized granulosa cells (HGrC1) and granulosa DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells (COV434), as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis, we investigated the effect of CHEMICAL_33848_PAH mixtures on the expression of the GENE_196_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor (GENE_196_AHR), GENE_405_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor_nuclear_translocator (GENE_405_ARNT) and CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor repressor (GENE_57491_AHRR) genes, as well as the expression and activity of target genes GENE_1543_cytochrome_P450_1A1 (GENE_1543_CYP1A1) and CHEMICAL_C034221_catechol-CHEMICAL__O-methyltransferase (GENE_1312_COMT).
28710019	The cells were exposed to mixture 1 (M1), composed of all 16 priority CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs, and mixture 2 (M2), composed of five CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs which are not classified as SPECIES_9606_human carcinogens, and which are observed in the highest amounts both in maternal and cord blood.
28710019	All 16 priority CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs were bioavailable in maternal and cord plasma, suggesting that perinatal exposure should be considered.
28710019	In HGrC1 cells, M1 increased GENE_196_AHR and GENE_405_ARNT, but decreased GENE_57491_AHRR expression, in parallel with increased GENE_1543_CYP1A1 and GENE_1312_COMT expression and activity.
28710019	M2 decreased GENE_196_AHR and GENE_57491_AHRR, and increased GENE_405_ARNT, with no effect on GENE_1543_CYP1A1 expression and activity; however, it did increase GENE_1312_COMT expression and activity.
28710019	In DISEASE_D009369_tumor cells, M1 lowered GENE_196_AHR and up-regulated GENE_57491_AHRR and GENE_405_ARNT expression, consequently decreasing GENE_1543_CYP1A1 expression and GENE_1312_COMT activity.
28710019	M2 up-regulated GENE_196_AHR and GENE_405_ARNT, down-regulated GENE_57491_AHRR, and had no effect on GENE_1543_CYP1A1 and GENE_1312_COMT expression, but decreased GENE_1312_COMT activity.
28710019	We hypothesise that, dependent on composition, mixtures of CHEMICAL_33848_PAHs activate the GENE_196_AHR differently through varying transcription responses: in HGrC1, a canonical GENE_196_AHR mechanism of M1, with activation of GENE_1543_CYP1A1 important for detoxication, while in COV434, a noncanonical GENE_196_AHR mechanism, probably by activation the nuclear factor NFkB.
28710020	GENE_4780_Nrf2 deficiency exacerbates CHEMICAL_C025589_ochratoxin_A-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in vitro and in vivo.
28710020	Several mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for nephrotoxic and nephrocarcinogenic activities of mycotoxin and food contaminant, CHEMICAL_C025589_ochratoxin_A (CHEMICAL__OTA).
28710020	Although GENE_10090)_Nrf2 transcription factor was suggested to be involved in CHEMICAL__OTA-mediated DISEASE_D007674_renal_injury, comprehensive study evaluating the effect of CHEMICAL__OTA toxicity in GENE_10090)_Nrf2 knock-out SPECIES_10090_mice with special regard to sex-dependency has not been performed yet.
28710020	Our results clearly show exacerbated CHEMICAL__OTA toxicity in porcine tubular epithelial cells after shRNA-mediated GENE_4780_Nrf2 inhibition as well as in proximal tubular cells isolated from GENE_4780_Nrf2-/- SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice in comparison to cells derived from their wild-type counterparts.
28710020	In vivo study revealed that SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice are significantly more susceptible to CHEMICAL__OTA-mediated injury than females and this effect was further enhanced in SPECIES_10090_mice lacking GENE_10090)_Nrf2.
28710020	CHEMICAL__OTA increased the expression of pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors, while concomitantly decreased the level of GENE_9075_claudin_2 and GENE_7422_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor (GENE_7422_VEGF).
28710020	Importantly, GENE_406991_miR_21, GENE_407040_miR_34a and GENE_494331_miR_382 were potently up-regulated after CHEMICAL__OTA delivery.
28710020	Noteworthy, treatment with CHEMICAL_C016766_sulforaphane (CHEMICAL__SFN), diminished expression of CHEMICAL__OTA-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6), pro-apoptotic factors (c-myc, SPECIES_9696_PUMA) and microRNAs (GENE_494331_miR_382, GENE_407040_miR_34a) in SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mice.
28710020	In summary, our data implies sex-dependent effect of CHEMICAL__OTA, with SPECIES_9606_males being more sensitive.
28710020	The lack of GENE_4780_Nrf2 enhances susceptibility to mycotoxin-induced pathologies, suggesting that modulation of the GENE_4780_Nrf2 pathway may provide a therapeutic approach to treat CHEMICAL__OTA-triggered DISEASE_D007674_renal_diseases.
28717100	Inhibitory modulation of SPECIES_9606_human CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor a and b activities by CHEMICAL_C036042_dicyclohexyl_phthalate in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell lines.
28717100	CHEMICAL_35484_Phthalate_esters (CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs) are SPECIES_9606_man-made compounds that are used widely in industry, and the ubiquitous exposure of SPECIES_9606_humans to CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs has been reported.
28717100	Although some CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs have been suggested to function as xenoestrogens in in vitro systems, such as SPECIES_9606_human CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors (ERs) expressed in SPECIES_10029_Chinese_hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, few studies have attempted to elucidate whether CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs affect SPECIES_9606_human GENE_2099_ERa/GENE_2100_ERb-mediated signaling in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells (i.e., combination between SPECIES_9606_human ERs and SPECIES_9606_human cells).
28717100	Thus, further experiments are needed in order to clarify the activities of CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs.
28717100	Among the 9 CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs (CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon# in the side chains: 2-8) investigated, CHEMICAL_D003993_dibutyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_35861_DBP), CHEMICAL_34680_dipentyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL__DPENP), and CHEMICAL_C036042_dicyclohexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_C064504_DCHP) were found to exhibit strong anti-estrogenic activities in MCF-7 cells (ER-positive) in the presence of 1 nM CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2).
28717100	Since limited information is currently available on CHEMICAL__DPENP and CHEMICAL_C064504_DCHP, we herein focused on these two CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs.
28717100	Experiments using MDA-MB-231 cells (ER-negative) transfected with SPECIES_9606_human GENE_2099_ERa or GENE_2100_ERb expression plasmids revealed that CHEMICAL_C064504_DCHP was a markedly stronger anti-estrogenic PAE than CHEMICAL__DPENP; CHEMICAL_C064504_DCHP inhibited GENE_2099_ERa and GENE_2100_ERb activities stimulated by 1 nM E2 with IC50 values of ~5 and 11.2   M, respectively.
28717100	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C064504_DCHP abrogated CHEMICAL_C492519_diarylpropionitrile (CHEMICAL_D009243_DPN)-stimulated GENE_2100_ERb activity with an IC50 value of 5.17   M, which was approximately 2-fold stronger than that of CHEMICAL__DPENP (IC50 = 10   M).
28717100	The results of the present study suggest that CHEMICAL_C039557_PAEs (CHEMICAL_C064504_DCHP) function not only as an anti-CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen for GENE_2099_ERa, but also for GENE_2100_ERb, at least in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell lines.
28718371	Changes in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and the relative telomere length in the process of DISEASE_D009369_canceration induced by CHEMICAL_C002302_omethoate.
28718371	Organophosphorous pesticides (OPs), with high efficiency, broad-spectrum and low residue, are widely used in China.
28718371	CHEMICAL_C002302_Omethoate is a broad category of CHEMICAL__organophosphorous pesticides and is more domestically utilized which has chronic toxic effect on SPECIES_9606_human health caused by long-term, low-dose exposure to Ops, recently its potential genotoxicity has attracted wide attention which can cause chromosomal DNA damage.
28718371	Thus, the aim of this study is screen susceptible biomarkers and explore the mechanism of DISEASE_D009369_canceration induced by CHEMICAL_C002302_omethoate.
28718371	180 long-term CHEMICAL_D010755_organophosphorus pesticide-exposed workers and 115 healthy controls were recruited.
28718371	Quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was applied to determine the relative telomere length in peripheral lymphocyte DNA as well as GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_644914_p21 gene expression levels.
28718371	Genetic polymorphisms were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
28718371	Multiple linear regression was conducted to explore the effects of exposure, expression levels, and polymorphisms in genes on the telomere length.
28718371	The results showed the relative telomere lengths in the exposure group were significantly longer than that in the control group.
28718371	The messenger RNA expression levels of GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_644914_p21 in exposure group were significantly lower than that in the control group; telomere lengths of the CA genotype individuals of GENE_644914_p21 SNP_rs1801270_rs1801270 polymorphism locus were significantly longer than that of the CC genotype in the control group that were estimated using the Bonferroni method; and bivariate correlation analysis showed that the messenger RNA expression level of gene GENE_7157_p53 was negatively correlated with telomere length, and the messenger RNA expression level of gene GENE_644914_p21 was positively correlated with telomere length.
28718371	Multivariate analysis found that GENE_7157_p53 messenger RNA and GENE_644914_p21 messenger RNA had an impact on telomere length.
28718371	These results demonstrated that the messenger RNA expression levels of GENE_7157_p53 and GENE_644914_p21 may have a relationship with the changes in telomere length induced by CHEMICAL_C002302_omethoate and provided strong evidence for the mechanism of DISEASE_D009369_canceration induced by poison.
28716455	The CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 paradox: Supplementation with high concentrations of CHEMICAL_D011736_pyridoxine leads to decreased CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 function.
28716455	CHEMICAL_D025101_Vitamin_B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that functions as a coenzyme in many reactions involved in CHEMICAL_D000596_amino_acid, CHEMICAL_D002241_carbohydrates and lipid metabolism.
28716455	Since 2014, >50 cases of sensory DISEASE_D010146_neuronal_pain due to CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 supplementation were reported.
28716455	Up to now, the mechanism of this DISEASE_D064420_toxicity is enigmatic and the contribution of the various B6 vitamers to this DISEASE_D064420_toxicity is largely unknown.
28716455	In the present study, the DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity of the different forms of CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 is tested on SHSY5Y and CaCo-2 cells.
28716455	Cells were exposed to CHEMICAL_D011736_pyridoxine, CHEMICAL_D011733_pyridoxamine, CHEMICAL_D011730_pyridoxal, CHEMICAL_D011732_pyridoxal_5_phosphate or CHEMICAL_18335_pyridoxamine_5_phosphate for 24h, after which cell viability was measured using the CHEMICAL_53233_MTT assay.
28716455	The expression of GENE_581_Bax and GENE_841_caspase_8 was tested after the 24h exposure.
28716455	The effect of the vitamers on two CHEMICAL_D011732_pyridoxal_5_phosphate dependent enzymes was also tested.
28716455	CHEMICAL_D011736_Pyridoxine induced cell death in a concentration-dependent way in SHSY5Y cells.
28716455	The other vitamers did not affect cell viability.
28716455	CHEMICAL_D011736_Pyridoxine significantly increased the expression of GENE_581_Bax and GENE_841_caspase_8.
28716455	Moreover, both CHEMICAL_D011732_pyridoxal_5_phosphate dependent enzymes were inhibited by CHEMICAL_D011736_pyridoxine.
28716455	In conclusion, the present study indicates that the DISEASE_D009422_neuropathy observed after taking a relatively high dose of CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 supplements is due to CHEMICAL_D011736_pyridoxine.
28716455	The inactive form CHEMICAL_D011736_pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active CHEMICAL_D011732_pyridoxal_5_phosphate.
28716455	Consequently, symptoms of CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 supplementation are similar to those of CHEMICAL_D025101_vitamin_B6 deficiency.
28716577	Apoptosis-related genes induced in response to CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine during early life stages of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28716577	Increasing evidence supports that CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine, a widely used anaesthetic, potentiates apoptosis during development through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
28716577	Defects in the apoptotic machinery can cause or contribute to the DISEASE_D006130_developmental_abnormalities previously described in CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine-exposed SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28716577	The involvement of the apoptotic machinery in CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine-induced DISEASE_C535542_teratogenicity was addressed by assessing the apoptotic signals at 8 and 24 hpf following 20min exposure to CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine at three stages of early SPECIES_7955_zebrafish embryo development (256 cell, 50% epiboly and 1-4 somites stages).
28716577	Exposure at the 256-cell stage to CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine induced an up-regulation of GENE_7955)_casp8 and pcna at 8 hpf while changes in pcna at the mRNA level were observed at 24 hpf.
28716577	After the 50% epiboly stage exposure, the mRNA levels of GENE_7955)_casp9 were increased at 8 and 24 hpf while GENE_7955)_aifm1 was affected at 24 hpf.
28716577	Both GENE_7955)_tp53 and pcna expressions were increased at 8 hpf.
28716577	After exposure during the 1-4 somites stage, no meaningful changes on transcript levels were observed.
28716577	The distribution of apoptotic cells and the caspase-like enzymatic activities of GENE_140621;492763_caspase_3_and_9 were not affected by CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine exposure.
28716577	It is proposed that CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine exposure at the 256-cell stage induced a cooperative mechanism between proliferation and cellular death while following exposure at the 50% epiboly, a GENE_7955)_p53-dependent and -independent caspase activation may occur.
28716577	Finally, at the 1-4 somites stage, the defence mechanisms are already fully in place to protect against CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine-insult.
28716577	Thus, CHEMICAL_D007649_ketamine DISEASE_C535542_teratogenicity seems to be dependent on the functional mechanisms present in each developmental stage.
28720485	CHEMICAL_C490727_Ceftaroline modulates the innate immune and host defense responses of immunocompetent cells exposed to cigarette smoke.
28720485	BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoke, the principal risk factor for DISEASE_D029424_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease (DISEASE_D029424_COPD), negatively influences the effectiveness of the immune system's response to a pathogen.
28720485	The antibiotic CHEMICAL_C490727_ceftaroline exerts immune-modulatory effects in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke.
28720485	AIMS AND METHODS: The present study aims to assess the effects of CHEMICAL_C490727_ceftaroline on TLR2 and TLR4 expression, DISEASE_C536528_LPS binding and TNF-a and human beta defensin (HBD2) release in an undifferentiated and CHEMICAL_60755_PMA-differentiated human monocyte cell line (THP-1) exposed or not to DISEASE_188890_cigarette_smoke_extracts (DISEASE_188890_CSE).
28720485	TLR2, TLR4, and DISEASE_C536528_LPS binding were assessed by flow cytometry, TNF-a and HBD2 release were evaluated by ELISA.
28720485	RESULTS: The constitutive expression of TLR2 and TLR4 and DISEASE_C536528_LPS binding were higher in differentiated compared to undifferentiated THP-1 cells.
28720485	In undifferentiated THP-1 cells, DISEASE_188890_CSE increased TLR2 and TLR4 protein levels, DISEASE_C536528_LPS binding and TNF-a release and reduced HBD2 release and CHEMICAL_C490727_ceftaroline counteracted all these effects.
28720485	In differentiated THP-1, DISEASE_188890_CSE did not significantly affect TLR2 and TLR4 expression and DISEASE_C536528_LPS binding but reduced HBD2 release and increased TNF-a release.
28720485	CHEMICAL_C490727_Ceftaroline counteracted the effects of DISEASE_188890_CSE on HBD2 release in differentiated THP-1.
28720485	CONCLUSION: CHEMICAL_C490727_Ceftaroline counteracts the effect of DISEASE_188890_CSE in immune cells by increasing the effectiveness of the innate immune system.
28720485	This effect may also assist in reducing pathogen activity and recurrent exacerbations in DISEASE_D029424_COPD patients.
28721559	Anatomical specificity of the brain in the modulation of GENE_10116)_Neuroglobin and GENE_10116)_Cytoglobin genes after chronic CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_a exposure.
28721559	The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) exposure on GENE_10116)_Neuroglobin (GENE_10116)_Ngb) and GENE_10116)_Cytoglobin (GENE_10116)_Cygb) as well as oxidative stress gene expression in the cerebellum, hippocampus, DISEASE_D007029_hypothalamus and cortex.
28721559	Male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control and two groups receiving 2 different daily CHEMICAL__BPA dosages, 5 or 25  mg/kg from postnatal day 50 (PND50) through PND90 and they were euthanized at PND105.
28721559	In the cortex, we found an increase in GENE_10116)_Ngb gene expression and also in CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase 1 and GENE_10116)_Catalase (Cat).
28721559	In the cerebellum, we found an increase in GENE_10116)_Ngb and Cat, in the DISEASE_D007029_hypothalamus, there was a decrease in GENE_10116)_Cygb and an increase in CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase and Cat and in GENE_10116)_hypoxia_inducible_factor_1_alpha (GENE_10116)_Hif1a) at the low dosage and a decrease in GENE_10116)_Hif1a at the high CHEMICAL__BPA dosage.
28721559	Finally, in the hippocampus, we observed a decrease in GENE_10116)_Ngb and GENE_10116)_Cygb and an increase in GENE_10116)_Hif1a.
28721559	In summary, CHEMICAL__BPA promotes the modulation of both GENE_10116)_Ngb and GENE_10116)_Cygb, but such changes occur by different mechanisms depending on the exposure dose and anatomical area.
28720477	CHEMICAL__Nanoquinacrine caused apoptosis in DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer stem cells by disrupting the interaction between GENE_2735_GLI1 and GENE_1499_b_catenin through activation of GENE_2932_GSK3b.
28720477	Presences of DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem cells (CSCs) in a bulk of DISEASE_D009369_cancer cells are responsible for DISEASE_D009369_tumor relapse, DISEASE_D009362_metastasis and drug resistance in DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer.
28720477	Due to high drug efflux, DNA repair and self-renewable capacity of CSCs, the conventional chemotherapeutic agents are unable to kill the CSCs.
28720477	CSCs utilizes Hedgehog (HH-GLI), WNT-GENE_1499_b_catenin signalling for its growth and development.
28720477	GENE_2932_GSK3b negatively regulates both the pathways in CSCs.
28720477	Here, we have shown that a nano-formulated bioactive small molecule inhibitor CHEMICAL_D011796_Quinacrine (NQC) caused apoptosis in DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer stem cells (OCSCs; isolated from different DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer cells and DISEASE_D009369_oral_cancer SPECIES_9606_patient derived primary cells) by down regulating WNT-GENE_1499_b_catenin and HH-GLI components through activation of GENE_2932_GSK3b.
28720477	NQC activates GENE_2932_GSK3b in transcriptional and translational level and reduces GENE_1499_b_catenin and GENE_2735_GLI1 as well as downstream target gene of both the pathways GENE_595_Cyclin_D1, GENE_4609_C_Myc.
28720477	The transcription factor activity of both the pathways was also reduced by CHEMICAL__NQC treatment.
28720477	GENE_2932_GSK3b, GENE_1499_b_catenin and GENE_2735_GLI1 interacts with each other and NQC disrupts the co-localization and interaction between GENE_1499_b_catenin and GENE_2735_GLI1 in OCSCs in a dose dependent manner through activation of GENE_2932_GSK3b.
28720477	Thus, data suggest NQC caused OCSCs death by disrupting the crosstalk between GENE_1499_b_catenin and GENE_2735_GLI1 by activation of GENE_2932_GSK3b.
28728135	DISEASE_D011471_Prostate_Cancer Risk and DNA Methylation Signatures in Aging SPECIES_10116_Rats following Developmental CHEMICAL__BPA Exposure: A Dose-Response Analysis.
28728135	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have uncovered heightened prostatic susceptibility to hormone-induced DISEASE_D009369_neoplasia from early-life exposure to low-dose CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA).
28728135	However, significant data gaps remain that are essential to address for biological relevance and necessary risk assessment.
28728135	OBJECTIVES: A complete CHEMICAL__BPA dose-response analysis of prostate lesions across multiple prostatic lobes was conducted that included internal CHEMICAL__BPA dosimetry, progression to DISEASE_D000230_adenocarcinoma with aging and mechanistic connections to epigenetically reprogramed genes.
28728135	METHODS: SPECIES_9606_Male neonatal SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats were briefly exposed to 0.1 to 5,000  g   CHEMICAL__BPA/kg   BW on postnatal days (PND) 1, 3, and 5.
28728135	Individual prostate lobes plus periurethral prostatic ducts were evaluated at 7 mo or 1 y of age without or with adult CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone plus CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol (T+E) to promote DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis.
28728135	DNA methylation of five genes was quantified by CHEMICAL_C042345_bisulfite genomic sequencing in d-200 dorsal prostates across CHEMICAL__BPA doses.
28728135	Serum free-CHEMICAL__BPA and CHEMICAL__BPA-glucuronide were quantitated in sera of individual PND 3 SPECIES_10090_pups collected 1 hr postexposure utilizing ultra-high-pressure tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS).
28728135	RESULTS: The lowest CHEMICAL__BPA dose initiated maximal hormonal DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis in lateral prostates despite undetectable free CHEMICAL__BPA 1 hr postexposure.
28728135	Further, DISEASE_D019048_prostatic_intraepithelial_neoplasia (DISEASE_D019048_PIN) progressed to DISEASE_D002277_carcinoma in SPECIES_10116_rats given neonatal low-dose CHEMICAL__BPA with adult T+E but not in SPECIES_10116_rats given adult T+E alone.
28728135	The dorsal and ventral lobes and periurethral prostatic ducts exhibited a nonmonotonic dose response with peak DISEASE_D019048_PIN, proliferation and apoptotic values at 10   100  g/kg BW.
28728135	This was paralleled by nonmonotonic and dose-specific DNA hypomethylation of genes that confer carcinogenic risk, with greatest hypomethylation at the lowest CHEMICAL__BPA doses.
28728135	CONCLUSIONS: Developmental CHEMICAL__BPA exposures heighten DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer susceptibility in a complex dose- and lobe-specific manner.
28728135	Importantly, elevated carcinogenic risk is found at doses that yield undetectable serum free CHEMICAL__BPA.
28728135	Dose-specific epigenetic modifications of selected genes provide a mechanistic framework that may connect early-life CHEMICAL__BPA to later-life predisposition to DISEASE_D011471_prostate_carcinogenesis.

28732690	Cromolyn chitosan nanoparticles as a novel protective approach for DISEASE_D015179_colorectal_cancer.
28732690	DISEASE_D015179_Colorectal_cancer is the third most common DISEASE_D009369_cancer in the world.
28732690	Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer and was proposed as an anticancer agent; however its high polarity limits its bioavailability by rapid washing from the body.
28732690	We formulated 10 cromolyn chitosan nanoparticles (CCSNPs)(1) following ionic gelation technique to improve its bioavailability and investigated the protective anticancer effect of the optimum formula against DISEASE_D015179_colorectal_cancer in CHEMICAL__dimethylhydrazine-induced model in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28732690	SPECIES_10116_Rats were divided into seven groups, group-1: normal control, group-2: cromolyn control, group-3: CCSNPs control, groups-4 to 7 received CHEMICAL__dimethylhydrazine for 16 weeks to induce DISEASE_D015179_colorectal_cancer.
28732690	Groups-5 to 7 received cromolyn solution, non-medicated chitosan nanoparticles and CCSNPs, respectively as protective treatments.
28732690	Optimum CCSNPs (size 112.4  nm, charge  +39.9  mV, enclosed 93.6% cromolyn and showed a sustained drug release pattern over 48  h) significantly reduced DISEASE_D009369_tumor-signaling molecules and the number of aberrant crypt foci compared to CHEMICAL__dimethylhydrazine.
28732690	Histopathological examination of colon samples revealed that CCSNPs exerted an augmented protective anticancer effect by ameliorating DISEASE_D009369_tumor pathology compared to cromolyn solution.
28732690	In conclusion, CCSNPs ameliorated DISEASE_D009369_tumor pathology and malignant oncogenic signaling molecules in DISEASE_D015179_colorectal_cancer tissue.
28732690	Thus, CCSNPs may provide a novel protective approach in DISEASE_D015179_colorectal_cancer treatment.
28732690	Moreover, encapsulating cromolyn in chitosan nanoparticles augmented the protective anticancer effect of the drug.
28733231	CHEMICAL__Tussilagonone-induced GENE_10090)_Nrf2 pathway activation protects HepG2 cells from oxidative injury.
28733231	CHEMICAL__Tussilagonone is a compound derived from the medicinal plant Tussilago farfara L., which is used as a traditional medicine for DISEASE_D012131_respiratory_diseases, including DISEASE_D001249_asthma and DISEASE_D011014_pneumonia.
28733231	Recent reports suggest that CHEMICAL__tussilagonone exhibits anti-inflammatory effects; however, the scope of protective functions has not been elucidated yet.
28733231	In this study, we demonstrate that CHEMICAL__tussilagonone enhances cellular detoxification by increasing GENE_10090)_quinone_reductase activity in Hepa1c1c7 cells.
28733231	In addition, CHEMICAL__tussilagonone decreased CHEMICAL_D020122_tert_butyl_hydroperoxide(CHEMICAL_64090_t_BHP)-induced ROS production and cell death, suggesting that it also acts as a potent antioxidant.
28733231	To verify the molecular mechanism underlying CHEMICAL__tussilagonone activity, we examined the expression of GENE_10090)_nuclear_factor_erythroid_2_related_factor_2(GENE_10090)_Nrf2)-a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant protein expression-in HepG2 cells.
28733231	Significantly, these results showed that CHEMICAL__tussilagonone induces GENE_10090)_Nrf2 activation and nuclear accumulation, resulting in the upregulation of the detoxifying enzymes CHEMICAL__NAD_P_H_quinone dehydrogenase 1(GENE_10090)_NQO1) and CHEMICAL_D006418_heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) that protect cells from oxidative stress.
28733231	Further molecular analyses revealed that CHEMICAL__tussilagonone-induced GENE_10090)_Nrf2 activation was mediated by GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 in HepG2 cells.
28733231	Collectively, these data indicate that CHEMICAL__tussilagonone attenuates CHEMICAL_64090_t_BHP-induced ROS and activates CHEMICAL_C004532_quinone reductase activity via GENE_10090)_Nrf2 pathway activation and target gene expression, and thereby acts as an antioxidant that protects HepG2 cells from oxidative stress and associated damage.
28728140	Effects of Inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic, CHEMICAL__Methylated_Arsenicals, and CHEMICAL_C038992_Arsenobetaine on DISEASE_D050197_Atherosclerosis in the SPECIES_10090_Mouse Model and the Role of GENE_10090)_As3mt-Mediated Methylation.
28728140	BACKGROUND: CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic is metabolized through a series of oxidative methylation reactions by CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic (3) methyltransferase (GENE_57412_As3MT) to yield methylated intermediates.
28728140	Although CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure is known to increase the risk of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis, the contribution of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic methylation and GENE_57412_As3MT remains undefined.
28728140	OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to define whether CHEMICAL__methylated_arsenic intermediates were proatherogenic and whether CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic biotransformation by GENE_57412_As3MT was required for CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-enhanced DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28728140	METHODS: We utilized the GENE_10090)_apoE   /    SPECIES_10090_mouse model to compare DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerotic plaque size and composition after inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic, methylated arsenical, or CHEMICAL_C038992_arsenobetaine exposure in drinking water.
28728140	We also generated GENE_10090)_apoE   /   /GENE_10090)_As3mt   /    double knockout SPECIES_10090_mice to test whether GENE_10090)_As3MT-mediated biotransformation was required for the proatherogenic effects of inorganic CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28728140	Furthermore, GENE_57412_As3MT expression and function were assessed in in vitro cultures of plaque-resident cells.
28728140	Finally, bone marrow transplantation studies were performed to define the contribution of GENE_57412_As3MT-mediated methylation in different cell types to the development of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis after inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure.
28728140	RESULTS: We found that CHEMICAL__methylated_arsenicals, but not CHEMICAL_C038992_arsenobetaine, are proatherogenic and that GENE_57412_As3MT is required for CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic to induce reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species and promote DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28728140	Importantly, GENE_57412_As3MT was expressed and functional in multiple plaque-resident cell types, and transplant studies indicated that GENE_57412_As3MT is required in extrahepatic tissues to promote DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28728140	CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicate that GENE_57412_As3MT acts to promote DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic and suggest that SPECIES_9606_human GENE_57412_AS3MT SNPs that correlate with enzyme function could predict those most at risk to develop DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis among the millions that are exposed to CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic.

28729173	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A impairs decidualization of SPECIES_9606_human uterine stromal fibroblasts.
28729173	This study examined the effect of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) exposure on SPECIES_9606_human uterine stromal fibroblast cells (HuF) undergoing decidualization.
28729173	HuF cells were isolated and cultured for eight days in the presence of a decidualization-inducing cocktail, while concurrently exposed to physiological and supra-physiologic doses of CHEMICAL__BPA (1ng/mL, 10ng/mL, 0.5 g/mL, 10 g/mL and 20 g/mL).
28729173	Decidualization markers, CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormone receptors and cell cycle gene expression were detected by qRT-PCR and cellular proliferation was assessed by KI-67 immunofluorescent staining and MTS assay.
28729173	CHEMICAL__BPA impaired decidualization at 10 g/mL and 20 g/mL, but not at lower doses.
28729173	Additionally, CHEMICAL__BPA at 20 g/mL decreased CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone receptor and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor-alpha compared to controls.
28729173	The highest dose of CHEMICAL__BPA also reduced cellular proliferation and GENE_894_cyclin_D2 expression compared to controls.
28729173	These findings demonstrate that CHEMICAL__BPA disrupts in vitro decidualization of uterine stromal fibroblasts by altering CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormone receptor expression at higher concentrations but not at lower physiological doses.
28736149	CHEMICAL_30785_Methylmercury augments GENE_4780_Nrf2 activity by downregulation of the Src family kinase GENE_2534_Fyn.
28736149	CHEMICAL_30785_Methylmercury (CHEMICAL__MeHg) is a potent developmental neurotoxicant that induces an oxidative stress response in the brain.
28736149	It has been demonstrated that CHEMICAL__MeHg exposure increases nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (GENE_4780_Nrf2) activity.
28736149	GENE_4780_Nrf2 is a transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress, and upregulates phase II detoxifying enzymes.
28736149	Although, GENE_4780_Nrf2 activity is augmented subsequent to CHEMICAL__MeHg exposure, it has yet to be established whether GENE_4780_Nrf2 moves into the nucleus as a result.
28736149	Furthermore, the potential effect CHEMICAL__MeHg might have on the non-receptor CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine kinase, GENE_2534_Fyn, has not been addressed.
28736149	GENE_2534_Fyn phosphorylates GENE_4780_Nrf2 in the nucleus, resulting in its inactivation, and consequent downregulation of the oxidative stress response.
28736149	Here, we observe GENE_4780_Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus subsequent to CHEMICAL__MeHg-induced oxidative stress.
28736149	This response is concomitant with reduced GENE_2534_Fyn expression and nuclear localization.
28736149	Moreover, we detected an increase in phosphorylated GENE_207_Akt and GENE_2932_glycogen_synthase_kinase_3_beta (GENE_2932_GSK_3b) at activating and inhibitory sites, respectively.
28736149	GENE_207_Akt phosphorylates and inhibits GENE_2932_GSK_3b, which subsequently prevents GENE_2534_Fyn phosphorylation to signal nuclear import.
28736149	Our results demonstrate CHEMICAL__MeHg downregulates GENE_2534_Fyn to maintain GENE_4780_Nrf2 activity, and further illuminate a potential mechanism by which CHEMICAL__MeHg elicits neurotoxicity.
28736254	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A affects trophoblast invasion by inhibiting GENE_3576_CXCL8 expression in decidual stromal cells.
28736254	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), an environmental endocrine-disrupting organic chemical, has been positively associated with the rate of implantation failure of in  vitro fertilization.
28736254	However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
28736254	To reveal the impact and the underlying mechanism of CHEMICAL__BPA on the crosstalk between trophoblast and decidual stromal cells (DSCs), we determined whether CHEMICAL__BPA was able to affect trophoblast invasion in  vitro.
28736254	We found that CHEMICAL__BPA significantly inhibited GENE_3576_CXCL8 expression in DSCs, which hindered trophoblast invasion, and activated the phosphorylation of GENE_5594_ERK in DSCs.
28736254	CHEMICAL_C113580_U0126, an inhibitor of GENE_5594_ERK activation, remarkably rescued trophoblast invasion and the inhibition of GENE_3576_CXCL8 expression caused by CHEMICAL__BPA treatment.
28736254	Moreover, the nuclear CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor antagonist CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI_182_780 and transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor GENE_2852_GPR30 (membrane CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor) antagonist G15 significantly blocked the phosphorylation of GENE_5594_ERK and reversed the reduction of trophoblast invasion.
28736254	In brief, CHEMICAL__BPA activated GENE_5594_ERK through nuclear and membrane CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors and inhibited GENE_3576_CXCL8 expression in DSCs, thereby affecting their regulation of trophoblast invasion.
28734741	Beneficial effects of TQRF and TQ nano- and conventional emulsions on DISEASE_D008569_memory_deficit, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant status, antioxidants genes expression and soluble Ab levels in DISEASE_C538646_high_fat_cholesterol_diet-induced SPECIES_10116_rats.
28734741	The study determined the effect of CHEMICAL_C003466_thymoquinone rich fraction (TQRF) and CHEMICAL_C003466_thymoquinone (TQ) in the forms of nano- and conventional emulsions on learning and memory, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant status, antioxidants genes expression and soluble b-amyloid (Ab) levels in SPECIES_10116_rats fed with a DISEASE_C538646_high_fat_cholesterol_diet (DISEASE_C538646_HFCD).
28734741	The TQRF was extracted from Nigella sativa seeds using a supercritical fluid extraction system and prepared into nanoemulsion, which later named as TQRF nanoemulsion (TQRFNE).
28734741	Meanwhile, TQ was acquired commercially and prepared into CHEMICAL_C003466_thymoquinone nanoemulsion (TQNE).
28734741	The TQRF and TQ conventional emulsions (CE), named as TQRFCE and TQCE, respectively were studied for comparison.
28734741	CHEMICAL_D019821_Statin (CHEMICAL_D019821_simvastatin) and non-CHEMICAL_D019821_statin (CHEMICAL_D011341_probucol) CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol-lowering agents, and a mild-to-severe DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease drug (CHEMICAL_C076946_donepezil) were served as control drugs.
28734741	The SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats were fed with DISEASE_C538646_HFCD for 6 months, and treated with the intervention groups via oral gavage daily for the last 3 months.
28734741	As a result, DISEASE_C538646_HFCD-fed SPECIES_10116_rats exhibited hypercholesterolaemia, accompanied by DISEASE_D008569_memory_deficit, increment of lipid peroxidation and soluble Ab levels, decrement of total antioxidant status and down-regulation of antioxidants genes expression levels.
28734741	TQRFNE demonstrated comparable effects to the other intervention groups and control drugs in serum biomarkers as well as in the learning and memory test.
28734741	Somehow, TQRFNE was more prominent than those intervention groups and control drugs in brain biomarkers concomitant to gene and protein expression levels.
28734741	Supplementation of TQRFNE into an DISEASE_C538646_HFCD thus could ameliorate DISEASE_D008569_memory_deficit, lipid peroxidation and soluble Ab levels as well as improving the total antioxidant status and antioxidants genes expression levels.
28734998	DISEASE_D004194_Oxidative_stress with DISEASE_D008569_tau_hyperphosphorylation_in_memory impaired CHEMICAL_C048792_1_2_diacetylbenzene-treated SPECIES_10090_mice.
28734998	Long-term exposure to organic solvent may be related to the incidence of DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_diseases, such as, DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease, DISEASE_D003866_depression, DISEASE_D009103_multiple_sclerosis, DISEASE_D003704_dementia, DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease.
28734998	Previously, the authors reported CHEMICAL_C048792_1_2_diacetylbenzene (CHEMICAL__DAB; a neurotoxic metabolite of CHEMICAL_C064750_1_2_diethylbenzene) causes DISEASE_D010523_central_and_peripheral_neuropathies that lead to motor DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_deficits.
28734998	Furthermore, it is known CHEMICAL__DAB increases oxidative stress and protein adduct levels and impairs hippocampal neurogenesis in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28734998	The authors examined the relevance of oxidative stress and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus.
28734998	Five-week-old male C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice were treated with 1 or 5mg/kg/day CHEMICAL__DAB for 2weeks.
28734998	Neither overall body weight increases nor behavioral differences were observed after treatment, but kidney and liver weights decreased.
28734998	Increased ROS production, activated GENE_10090)_glycogen_synthase_kinase_3b (GENE_10090)_GSK_3b) and tau hyperphosphorylation were observed in hippocampal homogenates.
28734998	To assess DISEASE_D008569_memory_impairment, the Morris Water Maze was used.
28734998	Animals in the CHEMICAL__DAB-treated groups took longer to reach the platform.
28734998	Movement patterns of CHEMICAL__DAB treated SPECIES_10090_mice were more complicated and their swimming speeds were lower than those of controls.
28734998	When SHSY5Y DISEASE_D009447_neuroblastoma cells were pretreated with GENE_6622_NAC (an antioxidant) or a GENE_2932_GSK_3b inhibitor, the expression of active GENE_2932_GSK_3b and tau hyperphosphorylation were reduced.
28734998	These results suggest ROS produced by CHEMICAL__DAB causes tau hyperphosphorylation via GENE_10090)_GSK_3b phosphorylation and it might be related to DISEASE_D003072_impaired_memory_deficit.
28739533	Effect of CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (BPA) on GENE_3630_insulin signal transduction and GENE_6517_GLUT4 translocation in gastrocnemius muscle of adult SPECIES_9606_male albino SPECIES_10116_rat.
28739533	Environmental CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens bind to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors, mimic estrogenic actions, and have adverse effects on SPECIES_9606_human health like CHEMICAL_22901_Bisphenol - A (BPA) which is used as a monomer in the production of CHEMICAL_61433_polycarbonate plastics (PC) and CHEMICAL_30721_epoxy resins which are used in variety of canned foods.
28739533	Skeletal muscle plays an essential role in maintaining systemic CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose metabolism.
28739533	In the present study, we investigated the possible effects of BPA on GENE_3630_insulin signalling molecules and GENE_6517_GLUT4 translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle of adult SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10116_rat.
28739533	SPECIES_10116_Rats were divided into four groups - Group I: Control (vehicle-SPECIES_381124_corn oil treated), Group II, III and IV were administered with BPA (10, 100 and 400mg/kg b.wt/day, respectively) through oral gavage.
28739533	Fasting blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose level of BPA treated groups showed a significant DISEASE_D018149_increase_oral_glucose_tolerance_and_insulin_tolerance were also impaired in these animals.
28739533	BPA significantly decreased the protein levels of GENE_3630_insulin signalling molecules like IR, GENE_3667_IRS_1, GENE_207_Akt, GENE_9882_AS160 and its phosphorylated forms and blunts GENE_6517_GLUT4 translocation by altering the levels of v- and t- SNARE proteins that assist the translocation process, thereby decreasing CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake and oxidation in the gastrocnemius muscle.
28739533	These results suggest that BPA has detrimental effects on GENE_3630_insulin signalling molecules and GENE_6517_GLUT4 translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle and thus impairs CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis.
28739874	The GENE_3845_K_Ras effector GENE_1432_p38y MAPK confers intrinsic resistance to CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine kinase inhibitors by stimulating GENE_1956_EGFR transcription and GENE_1956_EGFR dephosphorylation.
28739874	Mutations in GENE_3845_K_Ras and GENE_1956_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR) are mutually exclusive, but it is not known how GENE_3845_K_Ras activation inactivates GENE_1956_EGFR, leading to resistance of cancer cells to anti-GENE_1956_EGFR therapy.
28739874	Here, we report that the GENE_3845_K_Ras effector GENE_1432_p38y MAPK confers intrinsic resistance to small molecular CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by concurrently stimulating GENE_1956_EGFR gene transcription and protein dephosphorylation.
28739874	We found that p38y increases GENE_1956_EGFR transcription by GENE_3725_c_Jun-mediated promoter binding and stimulates GENE_1956_EGFR dephosphorylation via activation of GENE_5774_protein_tyrosine_phosphatase_H1 (GENE_5774_PTPH1).
28739874	Silencing the p38y/GENE_3725_c_Jun/GENE_5774_PTPH1 signaling network increased sensitivities to TKIs in GENE_3845_K_Ras mutant cells in which GENE_1956_EGFR knockdown inhibited growth.
28739874	Similar results were obtained with the p38y-specific pharmacological inhibitor CHEMICAL_C093844_pirfenidone.
28739874	These results indicate that in GENE_3845_K_Ras mutant cancers, GENE_1956_EGFR activity is regulated by the p38y/GENE_3725_c_Jun/GENE_5774_PTPH1 signaling network, whose disruption may be a novel strategy to restore the sensitivity to TKIs.
28739487	The ROS-mediated activation of GENE_10116)_IL_6/GENE_10116)_STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in the CHEMICAL_C076996_27_hydroxycholesterol-induced cellular senescence in nerve cells.
28739487	The CHEMICAL__oxysterol_27_hydroxycholesterol (CHEMICAL__27HC) is a selective CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs), which like endogenous CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2) induces the proliferation of ER-positive DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells in vitro.
28739487	Interestingly, the observation that CHEMICAL__27HC induces adverse effects in neural system, distinguishing it from E2.
28739487	It has been suggested that high levels of circulating CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol increase the entry of CHEMICAL__27HC into the brain, which may induce DISEASE_D003072_learning_and_memory_impairment.
28739487	Based on this evidence, CHEMICAL__27HC may be associated with neurodegenerative processes and interrupted CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol homeostasis in the brain.
28739487	However, the biological events that participate in this process remain largely elusive.
28739487	In the present study, we demonstrated that CHEMICAL__27HC induced apparent cellular senescence in nerve cells.
28739487	Senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-b-Gal) assay revealed that CHEMICAL__27HC induced senescence in both BV2 cells and PC12 cells.
28739487	Furthermore, we demonstrated that CHEMICAL__27HC promoted the accumulation of cellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) in nerve cells and subsequently activation of GENE_10116)_IL_6/GENE_10116)_STAT3 signaling pathway.
28739487	Notably, treatment with the ROS scavenger CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) markedly blocked CHEMICAL__27HC-induced ROS production and activation of GENE_10116)_IL_6/GENE_10116)_STAT3 signaling pathway.
28739487	Either blocking the generation of ROS or inhibition of GENE_10116)_IL_6/GENE_10116)_STAT3 both attenuated CHEMICAL__27HC-induced cellular senescence.
28739487	In sum, these findings not only suggested a mechanism whereby CHEMICAL__27HC induced cellular senescence in nerve cells, but also helped to recognize the CHEMICAL__27HC as a novel harmful factor in DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_diseases.
28743511	GENE_5894_Raf_1/CK2 and GENE_387_RhoA/ROCK signaling promote GENE_7124_TNF_a-mediated endothelial apoptosis via regulating GENE_7431_vimentin cytoskeleton.
28743511	Both GENE_387_RhoA/ROCK and GENE_5894_Raf_1/CK2 pathway play essential roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and multiple other common cellular functions.
28743511	We previously reported that GENE_7431_vimentin is responsible for GENE_7124_TNF_a-induced cell apoptosis.
28743511	Herein, we investigated the regulation of GENE_387_RhoA/ROCK and GENE_5894_Raf_1/CK2 signaling on GENE_7431_vimentin filaments and endothelial apoptosis mediated by GENE_7124_TNF_a.
28743511	Treatment with GENE_7124_TNF_a significantly induced the activation of GENE_387_RhoA and ROCK, and the expression of GENE_6093_ROCK1.
28743511	DISEASE_D003677_RhoA_deficiency could obviously inhibit ROCK activation and GENE_6093_ROCK1 expression induced by GENE_7124_TNF_a.
28743511	Both DISEASE_D003677_RhoA_deficiency and ROCK activity inhibition (CHEMICAL_C108830_Y_27632) greatly inhibited endothelial apoptosis and preserved cell viability in GENE_7124_TNF_a-induced SPECIES_9606_human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
28743511	Also GENE_7431_vimentin phosphorylation and the remodeling of GENE_7431_vimentin or CHEMICAL__phospho-GENE_7431_vimentin induced by GENE_7124_TNF_a were obviously attenuated by GENE_387_RhoA suppression and ROCK inhibition.
28743511	GENE_7124_TNF_a-mediated GENE_7431_vimentin cleavage was significantly inhibited by GENE_387_RhoA suppression and ROCK inhibition through decreasing the activation of GENE_836_caspase3 and 8.
28743511	Furthermore, GENE_7124_TNF_a treatment greatly enhanced the activation of GENE_5894_Raf_1.
28743511	Suppression of GENE_5894_Raf_1 or CK2 by its inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C489251_GW5074 or CHEMICAL__TBB) blocked GENE_7431_vimentin phosphorylation, remodeling and endothelial apoptosis, and preserved cell viability in GENE_7124_TNF_a-induced HUVECs.
28743511	However, GENE_5894_Raf_1 inhibition showed no significant effect on GENE_7124_TNF_a-induced ROCK expression and activation, suggesting that the regulation of GENE_5894_Raf_1/CK2 signaling on GENE_7431_vimentin was independent of ROCK.
28743511	Taken together, these results indicate that both GENE_387_RhoA/ROCK and GENE_5894_Raf_1/CK2 pathway are responsible for GENE_7124_TNF_a-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity via regulating GENE_7431_vimentin cytoskeleton.
28743636	CHEMICAL_D014635_Valproate increases CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine transporter expression through histone acetylation and enhanced promoter binding of GENE_10116)_Nurr1.
28743636	The CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine transporter (GENE_10116)_DAT) is the key regulator of dopaminergic transmission and is a target of several xenobiotics, including pesticides and pharmacological agents.
28743636	Previously, we identified a prominent role for histone deacetylases in the regulation of GENE_10116)_DAT expression.
28743636	Here, we utilized a SPECIES_10116_rat dopaminergic cell line (N27) to probe the responsiveness of GENE_10116)_DAT mRNA expression to inhibitors of histone acetylation.
28743636	Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by CHEMICAL_D014635_valproate, CHEMICAL_D002087_butyrate and CHEMICAL_C012589_Trichostatin_A led to a 3-10-fold increase in GENE_10116)_DAT mRNA expression, a 50% increase in protein levels, which were accompanied by increased H3 acetylation levels.
28743636	To confirm the mechanism of CHEMICAL_D014635_valproate-mediated increase in GENE_10116)_DAT mRNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used and demonstrated a significant increase in enrichment of acetylation of histone 3 on CHEMICAL__lysines 9 and 14 (H3K9/K14ac) in the GENE_10116)_DAT promoter.
28743636	Expression of GENE_10116)_Nurr1 and GENE_10116)_Pitx3, key regulators of GENE_10116)_DAT expression, were increased following CHEMICAL_D014635_valproate treatment and GENE_10116)_Nurr1 binding was enriched in the GENE_10116)_DAT promoter.
28743636	Together, these results indicate that histone acetylation and subsequent enhancement of transcription factor binding are plausible mechanisms for GENE_10116)_DAT regulation by CHEMICAL_D014635_valproate and, perhaps, by other xenobiotics.
28744220	CHEMICAL_C041376_Rosmarinic_Acid Protects against Inflammation and Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis during DISEASE_D017202_Myocardial_Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Activating GENE_10116)_Peroxisome_Proliferator_Activated_Receptor_Gamma.
28744220	The DISEASE_D006331_cardiac_ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury greatly influences the therapeutic effect and remains an urgent challenge in clinical therapy.
28744220	Polypharmacology opens a new therapeutic opportunity to design drugs with a specific target for improving the efficacy.
28744220	In this study, we first forecasted that CHEMICAL_C041376_Rosmarinic_acid (CHEMICAL__RosA) could be used for the treatment of DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease using text mining, chemometric and chemogenomic methods.
28744220	Consistent with the effect of the positive drug (CHEMICAL_C060836_pioglitazone, CHEMICAL__PIO), we subsequently validated that CHEMICAL__RosA pretreatment could restore the decreased cardiac hemodynamic parameters (LVDP,    dp/dtmin,    dp/dtmax and DISEASE_D003550_CF), decreased the DISEASE_D007238_infarct size and the cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a SPECIES_10116_rat model of DISEASE_D015427_cardiac_I_R_injury.
28744220	Furthermore, CHEMICAL__RosA pre-treatment inhibited the levels of inflammatory cytokines (GENE_10116)_IL_6, GENE_10116)_TNF_a and CRP), up-regulated PPARy expression and down-regulated GENE_10116)_NF_kB expression in myocardial tissue isolated from the SPECIES_10116_rat model of I/R-induced DISEASE_D009202_myocardial_injury.
28744220	In addition, the effects of CHEMICAL__RosA were reversed by co-treatment with GENE_10116)_PPAR-y inhibitor CHEMICAL_C457499_GW9662 and CHEMICAL_C458508_T0070907, respectively.
28744220	These data suggest that CHEMICAL__RosA attenuates cardiac injury through activating PPARy and down-regulating GENE_10116)_NF_kB-mediated signaling pathway, which inhibiting DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a SPECIES_10116_rat model of DISEASE_D015427_cardiac_I_R_injury.
28741210	Effects of CHEMICAL__BPF on CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormone homeostasis and gene expression in the DISEASE_D007029_hypothalamic_pituitary_gonadal_axis of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28741210	CHEMICAL__Bisphenol_F (CHEMICAL__BPF) has been frequently detected in various environmental compartments, and previous studies found that CHEMICAL__BPF exhibits similar estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects on the SPECIES_9606_mammalian endocrine system to those of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA).
28741210	However, the potential disrupting effects of CHEMICAL__BPF on aquatic organisms and the underling disrupting mechanisms have not been investigated.
28741210	In this study, the potential disrupting mechanisms of CHEMICAL__BPF on the DISEASE_D007029_hypothalamic_pituitary_gonadal_HPG_axis and liver were probed by employing the OECD 21-day short-term fecundity assay in SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28741210	The results show that CHEMICAL__BPF exposure (1  mg/L) impaired the reproductive function of SPECIES_7955_zebrafish, as exemplified by alterations to testicular and ovarian histology of the treated SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28741210	Homogenate CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone (T) levels in male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, and CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2) levels increased significantly when fish were exposed to 0.1 and 1  mg/L CHEMICAL__BPF.
28741210	The real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine gene expression in the DISEASE_D007029_HPG_axis and liver.
28741210	Hepatic GENE_101882735_vitellogenin expression was significantly upregulated in males, suggesting that CHEMICAL__BPF possesses estrogenic activity.
28741210	The disturbed hormone balance was enhanced by the significant changes in gene expression along the DISEASE_D007029_HPG_axis.
28741210	These alterations suggest that CHEMICAL__BPF leads to adverse effects on the endocrine system of teleost fish, and that these effects were more prominent in males than in females.
28745489	The Dihydroxy Metabolite of the Teratogen CHEMICAL_D013792_Thalidomide Causes Oxidative DNA Damage.
28745489	CHEMICAL_D013792_Thalidomide [CHEMICAL__a_N_phthalimido_glutarimide] (1) is a sedative and antiemetic drug originally introduced into the clinic in the 1950s for the treatment of morning sickness.
28745489	Although marketed as entirely safe, more than 10   000 babies were born with severe DISEASE_D000014_birth_defects.
28745489	CHEMICAL_D013792_Thalidomide was banned and subsequently approved for the treatment of multiple DISEASE_D009101_myeloma and complications associated with DISEASE_D007918_leprosy.
28745489	Although known for more than 5 decades, the mechanism of teratogenicity remains to be conclusively understood.
28745489	Various theories have been proposed in the literature including DNA damage and ROS and inhibition of angiogenesis and cereblon.
28745489	All of the theories have their merits and limitations.
28745489	Although the recently proposed cereblon theory has gained wide acceptance, it fails to explain the metabolism and low-dose requirement reported by a number of groups.
28745489	Recently, we have provided convincing structural evidence in support of the presence of CHEMICAL__arene_oxide and the CHEMICAL_C004532_quinone-reactive intermediates.
28745489	However, the ability of these reactive intermediates to impart DISEASE_D064420_toxicity/teratogenicity needs investigation.
28745489	Herein we report that the oxidative metabolite of CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide, CHEMICAL__dihydroxythalidomide, is responsible for generating ROS and causing DNA damage.
28745489	We show, using cell lines, the formation of comet (DNA damage) and ROS.
28745489	Using DNA-cleavage assays, we also show that GENE_847_catalase, radical scavengers, and desferal are capable of inhibiting DNA damage.
28745489	A mechanism of teratogenicity is proposed that not only explains the DNA-damaging property but also the metabolism, low concentration, and species-specificity requirements of CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide.
28750898	The use of a unique co-culture model of fetoplacental steroidogenesis as a screening tool for endocrine disruptors: The effects of CHEMICAL__neonicotinoids on aromatase activity and hormone production.
28750898	CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen biosynthesis during pregnancy is dependent on the collaboration between the fetus producing the CHEMICAL_50113_androgen precursors, and the placenta expressing the enzyme aromatase (GENE_1588_CYP19).
28750898	Disruption of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen production by contaminants may result in serious pregnancy outcomes.
28750898	We used our recently developed in vitro co-culture model of fetoplacental steroidogenesis to screen the effects of three neonicotinoid insecticides on the catalytic activity of aromatase and the production of CHEMICAL_D013256_steroid hormones.
28750898	A co-culture of H295R SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D018268_adrenocortical_carcinoma cells with fetal characteristics and BeWo SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D002822_choriocarcinoma cells which display characteristics of the villous cytotrophoblast was exposed for 24h to various concentrations of three CHEMICAL__neonicotinoids: CHEMICAL_C417209_thiacloprid, CHEMICAL_C416660_thiamethoxam and CHEMICAL_C082359_imidacloprid.
28750898	Aromatase catalytic activity was determined in both cell lines using the tritiated water-release assay.
28750898	Hormone production was measured by ELISA.
28750898	The three CHEMICAL__neonicotinoids induced aromatase activity in our fetoplacental co-culture and concordingly, CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol and CHEMICAL_D004970_estrone production were increased.
28750898	In contrast, CHEMICAL_D004964_estriol production was strongly inhibited by the CHEMICAL__neonicotinoids.
28750898	All three pesticides induced the expression of GENE_1551_CYP3A7 in H295R cells, and this induction was reversed by co-treatment of H295R cells with exogenous CHEMICAL_D004964_estriol.
28750898	We suggest that CHEMICAL__neonicotinoids are metabolized by GENE_1551_CYP3A7, thus impeding the 16a-hydroxylation of fetal CHEMICAL_D019314_DHEA_sulfate_, which is normally converted to CHEMICAL_D004964_estriol by placental aromatase.
28750898	We successfully used the fetoplacental co-culture as a physiologically relevant tool to highlight the potential effects of CHEMICAL__neonicotinoids on CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen production, aromatase activity and GENE_1551_CYP3A7 expression during pregnancy.
28751236	Binding of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A, CHEMICAL_C583074_bisphenol_AF, and CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S on the CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor: Coregulator recruitment and stimulation of potential interaction sites.
28751236	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), CHEMICAL_C583074_bisphenol_AF (CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF), and CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS) are well known endocrine disruptors.
28751236	Previous in vitro studies showed that these compounds antagonize CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor (GENE_367_AR) transcriptional activity; however, the mechanisms of action are unclear.
28751236	In the present study, we investigated interactions of coregulator peptides with CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF, or CHEMICAL__BPS at the GENE_367_AR complexes using Micro Array for Real-time Coregulator Nuclear Receptor Interaction (MARCoNI) assays and assessed the binding of these compounds on GENE_367_AR by DISEASE_D030342_molecular_dynamics (DISEASE_D030342_MD) simulations.
28751236	The set of coregulator peptides that are recruited by CHEMICAL__BPA-bound GENE_367_AR, either positively/or negatively, are different from those recruited by the agonist CHEMICAL_D015741_R1881-bound GENE_367_AR.
28751236	Therefore, the data indicates that CHEMICAL__BPA shows no similarities to R1881 and suggests that it may recruit other coregulators to the GENE_367_AR complex.
28751236	CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF-bound GENE_367_AR recruits about 70-80% of the same coregulator peptides as CHEMICAL__BPA-bound GENE_367_AR.
28751236	Meanwhile, CHEMICAL__BPS-bound GENE_367_AR interacts with only few peptides compared to CHEMICAL__BPA or CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF-bound GENE_367_AR.
28751236	DISEASE_D030342_MD results show that multiple binding sites with varying binding affinities are available on GENE_367_AR for CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL_C089739_BPAF, and CHEMICAL__BPS, indicating the availability of modified binding surfaces on GENE_367_AR for coregulator interactions.
28751236	These findings help explain some of the distinct GENE_367_AR-related DISEASE_D064420_toxicities observed with CHEMICAL_22901_bisphenol chemicals and raise concern for the use of substitutes for CHEMICAL__BPA in commercial products.
28755286	Assessment of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on cock muscular tissue: alterations of oxidative damage parameters, inflammatory cytokines and DISEASE_D012769_heat_shock proteins.
28755286	To evaluate the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3) in the muscular tissues (wing, thigh and pectoral) of birds, 72 one-day-old Hy-line cocks were selected and randomly divided into four groups.
28755286	They were fed either a commercial diet or an CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-supplemented diet containing 7.5, 15 or 30   mg/kg CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3.
28755286	The experiment lasted for 90 days and the samples of muscular tissues were collected at 30, 60 and 90 days.
28755286	The results showed that CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure significantly lowered the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase (CAT), CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-Px)) and inhibition ability of CHEMICAL_D017665_hydroxyl radicals (OH) and increased the CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) contents.
28755286	Furthermore, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (GENE_7124_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_7124_TNF_a), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), GENE_5743_cyclooxygenase_2 (GENE_5743_COX_2), GENE_4843_inducible_NO_synthase (GENE_4843_iNOS), GENE_9536_prostaglandin_E_synthase (GENE_9536_PTGEs)) and DISEASE_D012769_heat_shock proteins (HSPs) in muscular tissue were significantly upregulated in the CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure groups.
28755286	The results indicated that CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure resulted in oxidative damage, induced the inflammatory response, and influenced the mRNA levels of HSPs in muscular tissue of cocks.
28755286	Additionally, the results suggested that HSPs possibly resisted due to the CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 exposure-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response, which provided a favorable environment and played protective roles in the muscular tissues of cocks.
28755286	The information presented in this study is helpful to understand the mechanism of CHEMICAL_30621_As2O3 DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in bird muscular tissues.
28756148	CHEMICAL_C026474_Ginsenoside_Rg2 protects PC12  cells against b-amyloid25-35-induced apoptosis via the CHEMICAL_18179_phosphoinositide 3-kinase/GENE_10116)_Akt pathway.
28756148	DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease (DISEASE_D000544_AD) is one of the most debilitating DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_diseases in an aging population.
28756148	Excessive accumulation of b-amyloid (Ab) has been proposed as a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D000544_AD.
28756148	CHEMICAL_C026474_Ginsenoside_Rg2 has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects.
28756148	However, the underlying mechanism for its neuroprotection is not well-understood.
28756148	In this study, we investigated the protective effects of CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 on Ab25-35-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity in PC12  cells and identified a potential molecular signaling pathway involved.
28756148	The results showed that pretreatment of PC12  cells with CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 followed by Ab25-35 increased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner compared to cells that were not pretreated.
28756148	In addition, CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 pretreatment attenuated Ab25-35-induced increases in the release of CHEMICAL_D019344_lactate dehydrogenase, the intracellular CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium concentration, and levels of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species.
28756148	Pretreatment with CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 increased the GENE_10116)_Bcl_2/GENE_10116)_Bax ratio.
28756148	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 attenuated the cleavage of GENE_10116)_caspase_3 induced by Ab25-35 thereby improving cell survival.
28756148	CHEMICAL_C026474_Ginsenoside_Rg2 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of GENE_10116)_Akt in PC12  cells.
28756148	Additionally, pretreatment with the CHEMICAL_18179_phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002, completely abolished the protective effects of CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 against Ab25-35-induced neuronal cell apoptosis.
28756148	These findings unambiguously suggested that the protective effect of CHEMICAL_C026474_ginsenoside_Rg2 against Ab25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12  cells was associated with enhancement of the PI3K/GENE_10116)_Akt signaling pathway.
28756150	A marine sponge alkaloid derivative CHEMICAL__4_chloro_fascaplysin inhibits DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth and GENE_10090)_VEGF mediated angiogenesis by disrupting PI3K/GENE_10090)_Akt/GENE_10090)_mTOR signaling cascade.
28756150	Tumor angiogenesis and PI3K/GENE_10090)_Akt/GENE_10090)_mTOR pathway are two major molecular objectives for the treatment and management of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28756150	Here we first time report the molecular mechanism of a marine sponge alkaloid derivative CHEMICAL__4_chloro_fascapysin (CHEMICAL__4_CF) for its anticancer and antiangiogenesis potential.
28756150	It simultaneously targets multiple DISEASE_D009369_cancer and angiogenesis dynamics, such as proliferation, chemotaxis cell migration, and invasion, growth factors signaling cascade, autophagy and apoptosis in HUVEC and MDAMB-231 DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28756150	It inhibited the GENE_10090)_VEGF mediated microvessel sprouting and blood vessel formation in the matrigel plug of C57/BL6J SPECIES_10090_mice.
28756150	It inhibits the DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth in ET (solid) SPECIES_10090_mouse DISEASE_D009369_tumor model.
28756150	It significantly inhibited cell survival through PI3K/GENE_10090)_Akt/GENE_10090)_mTOR pathway, with attendant effects on key pro-angiogenesis factors like GENE_10090)_HIF_1a, eNOS and GENE_17390;17395_MMP_2_9.
28756150	The DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of CHEMICAL__4_CF was reversed by co-treatment with the GENE_10090)_VEGF and GENE_10090)_Akt inhibitors CHEMICAL_C473478_sunitinib and CHEMICAL_C105905_perifosine, respectively or by the addition of neutralizing GENE_10090)_VEGF antibodies.
28756150	The apoptotic potential of CHEMICAL__4_CF was through mitochondrial dependent as illustrated through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
28756150	The safety profile of CHEMICAL__4_CF was acceptable as it exhibits five times high cytotoxic IC50 value in normal cells as well as no apparent DISEASE_D064420_toxicities in experimental DISEASE_D009369_tumor SPECIES_10090_mice at therapeutic doses.
28757134	Effects of combined CHEMICAL_D010833_inositol_hexakisphosphate and CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol supplement on antioxidant activity and metabolic enzymes in the liver of CHEMICAL_D013311_streptozotocin-induced type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats.
28757134	DISEASE_D003920_Diabetes_mellitus is associated with elevated reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species, lipid abnormalities, reduced antioxidant activity and organ damage.
28757134	This study examines the effects of combined CHEMICAL_D010833_inositol_hexakisphosphate (IP6) and CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol supplement on antioxidant levels and other biochemical parameters in the liver of type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats.
28757134	Five groups of SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats were studied.
28757134	Six SPECIES_10116_rats were fed normal diet (non-DISEASE_D003920_diabetic control), while 24 SPECIES_10116_rats were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks.
28757134	DISEASE_D003920_Diabetes was induced in 18 of the SPECIES_10116_rats fed HFD by intraperitoneal administration of CHEMICAL_D013311_streptozotocin.
28757134	The DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats were separated into three groups namely: combined IP6 and CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol, CHEMICAL_D005905_glibenclamide and DISEASE_D003920_diabetic control.
28757134	The non-DISEASE_D003920_diabetic group fed high-fat diet was classified as a high-fat control group.
28757134	For the final four weeks of the experiment, all SPECIES_10116_rats were fed normal diet and given their respective treatment regimes.
28757134	Hepatic antioxidant status, metabolic enzyme activity, lipid profile, peroxidative damage and liver histology, as well as, serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, and total CHEMICAL_D001663_bilirubin concentration were assessed.
28757134	Treatment with combined IP6 and CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol supplement significantly increased liver reduced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione and high-density lipoprotein levels while liver CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride levels and serum alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly reduced by 27%, 50%, 38.5%, and 69.2% respectively compared to the DISEASE_D003920_diabetic control.
28757134	Hepatic CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase, GENE_10116)_catalase, GENE_10116)_glucose_6_phosphate_dehydrogenase activities were significantly upregulated by 55%, 26% and 53% respectively in the DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats treated with combined IP6 and CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol compared to the DISEASE_D003920_diabetic control.
28757134	Combined IP6 and CHEMICAL_D007294_inositol treatment resulted in the preservation of liver cell integrity and improved antioxidant status in type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetic SPECIES_10116_rats.
28754375	An evaluation of myeloperoxidase-mediated bio-activation of NSAIDs in DISEASE_D015473_promyelocytic_leukemia (HL-60) cells for potential cytotoxic selectivity.
28754375	Several lines of evidence have pointed towards the potential therapeutic benefit of NSAIDs in DISEASE_D009369_cancer therapy.
28754375	In this study, we have investigated the acute bio-activation of NSAIDs and their metabolites via myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly-expressed peroxidase enzyme in DISEASE_D015470_acute_myeloid_leukemia.
28754375	As bio-activation involves the formation of reactive metabolites, we hypothesized that NSAIDs which produced reactive metabolites would be correlated with DISEASE_D007938_leukemia cell DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28754375	We tested the enzymatic peroxidation of three NSAIDs, namely CHEMICAL_D004008_diclofenac, CHEMICAL_D007213_indomethacin, and CHEMICAL_D009288_naproxen in comparison with their hepatic metabolites, CHEMICAL_C108036_4_hydroxydiclofenac (CHEMICAL__4_OHD), CHEMICAL_C117715_5_hydroxydiclofenac (CHEMICAL__5_OHD), CHEMICAL__O_desmethyl_N_deschlorobenzoylindomethacin (CHEMICAL__DMBI), CHEMICAL_C034674_O_desmethylindomethacin (CHEMICAL_47781_DMI) and CHEMICAL__O_desmethylnaproxen (CHEMICAL__ODN).
28754375	Firstly, we used purified peroxidases in kinetic UV-vis kinetic spectrophotometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments to determine oxidation of CHEMICAL_D001205_ascorbic_acid and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH), respectively.
28754375	We then used HL-60 cells, as a model of DISEASE_D015470_acute_myelogenous_leukemia to carry out CHEMICAL_D014343_trypan_blue exclusion, cellular CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP analysis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytofluorometric CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH assays.
28754375	Our results present evidence that CHEMICAL_D004008_diclofenac, CHEMICAL__4_OHD, CHEMICAL__5_OHD, CHEMICAL__DMBI and CHEMICAL_47781_DMI demonstrated significant cytotoxic effect in the leukemic cells through oxidation by intracellular MPO.
28754375	In the same vein, only CHEMICAL_D004008_diclofenac and its two metabolites caused a significant drop in the MMP and cellular CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP level; however, the cell death induced by CHEMICAL_D007213_indomethacin metabolites reflected a subtle effect on MMP or CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH content.
28754375	Interestingly, only CHEMICAL_D004008_diclofenac and CHEMICAL__4_OHD (and not CHEMICAL__5_OHD) caused a significant drop in HL-60 cells' CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH content.
28754375	Among CHEMICAL_D004008_diclofenac compounds, only CHEMICAL__4_OHD also generated DISEASE_D011125_GS radical and caused a significant increase in CHEMICAL_38290_ascorbate co-oxidation rate.
28754375	Lastly, even though CHEMICAL__ODN also generated DISEASE_D011125_GS radical and potently cooxidized CHEMICAL_38290_ascorbate, it showed no significant DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28754375	These results provide evidence of a correlation between acute DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity and MPO-bioactivated NSAIDs, though this was not correlated for all compounds (e.g., CHEMICAL__ODN).
28754375	Further studies are required to determine both the MPO-dependent and MPO-independent mechanisms of DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28754437	Inactivation of the orphan nuclear receptor GENE_3164_NR4A1 contributes to apoptosis induction by CHEMICAL_C060802_fangchinoline in DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_cancer cells.
28754437	Previous studies have demonstrated that the orphan nuclear receptor GENE_3164_NR4A1 is overexpressed in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_cancer and antagonizing this receptor promotes apoptosis and inhibits DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_cancer cells and DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth.
28754437	In the present study, we identified CHEMICAL_C060802_fangchinoline, a CHEMICAL__bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline_alkaloid from Stephania tetrandra, as a new inactivator of nuclear GENE_3164_NR4A1 and demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C060802_fangchinoline inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, in part, via the GENE_3164_NR4A1-dependent pro-apoptotic pathways in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_cancer cells.
28754437	It decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin by inhibiting GENE_6667_Sp1-mediated transcription and induced oxidative stress-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_cancer cells.
28754437	These results suggest that inhibition of GENE_3164_NR4A1-mediated transcriptional activity was involved in the anticancer effects of CHEMICAL_C060802_fangchinoline, and CHEMICAL_C060802_fangchinoline represents a novel class of mechanism-based anticancer agents targeting GENE_3164_NR4A1 that is overexpressed in DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_cancer.
28760545	Reactive CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl compounds impair wound healing by GENE_7431_vimentin collapse and loss of the primary cilium.
28760545	In renal pathologies tubulo-interstitial DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis results from an aberrant wound-healing ability where the normal epithelial tissue is substituted for scar tissue caused by accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM).
28760545	During the wound-healing process, epithelial cells may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) acquiring a mesenchymal-like phenotype that allows cells to migrate and re-epithelialize the wound site.
28760545	It has been reported that chronic DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and uremic milieu are involved in wound-healing and enhanced DISEASE_D007674_kidney_damage in DISEASE_D051436_chronic_kidney_disease (DISEASE_D051436_CKD) SPECIES_9606_patients.
28760545	In this study we evaluated DISEASE_C537188_reactive_carbonyl_compounds (DISEASE_C537188_RCC) effects on renal wound healing.
28760545	The compounds resulting from CHEMICAL_23019_carbonyl stress evaluated in this study were CHEMICAL_D006037_glyoxal (GO), CHEMICAL_D011765_methylglyoxal (CHEMICAL_31794_MGO), CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) and CHEMICAL_C063409_4_hydroxy_hexenal (CHEMICAL_33689_HHE).
28760545	Wound repair ability was evaluated by the wound healing assay using SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells.
28760545	EMT was evaluated by morphological, protein and transcriptional changes using microscopy, western blot, zymography and RT-qPCR.
28760545	Changes in the GENE_7431_vimentin network and primary cilia were assessed by immunofluorescence.
28760545	Our data demonstrated that CHEMICAL_566274_MDA and GO delay wound closure mediated by GENE_7431_vimentin disruption, which caused collagen I mRNA decrease, and deciliation.
28760545	In contrast, CHEMICAL_33689_HHE treatment (and CHEMICAL_31794_MGO to a minor degree) induced morphological changes and increased mesenchymal marker expression and gelatinase activity in SPECIES_9606_HK_2  cells.
28760545	In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that exposure to DISEASE_C537188_RCC differentially affects wound healing in proximal tubular epithelia.
28760545	A better comprehension of effects of uremic toxins on wound healing and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis and migration is necessary to seek mechanisms to slow down renal DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28757136	CHEMICAL__Iminoenamine based novel GENE_367_androgen_receptor antagonist exhibited DISEASE_D011471_anti_prostate_cancer activity in CHEMICAL_50113_androgen independent prostate cancer cells through inhibition of GENE_207_AKT pathway.
28757136	Treatment by CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor (GENE_367_AR) antagonists is one of the regimens for DISEASE_D011471_prostate_cancer.
28757136	The prolonged treatment with GENE_367_AR antagonist leads to the expression of point mutation in the ligand binding domain of the GENE_367_AR.
28757136	This point mutation causes resistance to GENE_367_AR antagonist by converting them into an agonist.
28757136	The DNAMUTATION_c|SUB|T|887|A_T887A mutated GENE_367_AR was frequently expressed in CHEMICAL_50113_androgen independent prostate cancer (DISEASE_D011471_AIPC) SPECIES_9606_patients.
28757136	Through literature survey and molecular modelling, we have identified a novel GENE_367_AR antagonist having a bulky CHEMICAL__b_iminoenamine GENE_2290_BF2 complex scaffold.
28757136	The tested and standard ligands were screened in GENE_367_AR positive (LNCaP, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453), GENE_367_AR negative (GENE_57332_PC3), and non-cancerous (3T3) cell lines through anti-proliferation assay.
28757136	The ligand, ARA3 was the most potent molecule among all the tested ligands and was 7.6 folds selective for GENE_367_AR positive cell lines.
28757136	The mechanism of DISEASE_D011471_anti_prostate_cancer activity of ARA3 was confirmed by western blot, qPCR, and apoptotic assays in LNCaP (DNAMUTATION_c|SUB|T|887|A_T887A positive GENE_367_AR) cells.
28757136	Structural activity relationship was derived by correlating the in-vitro and in-silico data.
28757136	Consequently, we have identified the essential functional groups that could prevent the resistance concerning mutant GENE_367_AR.
28757136	The ARA3 induces the apoptosis in DISEASE_D011471_AIPC cells by preventing the GENE_367_AR mediated activation of GENE_207_AKT pathway.
28757136	The CHEMICAL_C053541_bicalutamide did not induce the apoptosis because it failed to prevent the GENE_367_AR mediated activation of GENE_207_AKT.
28759639	G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 promotes DISEASE_D006332_cardiac_hypertrophy.
28759639	The increase in protein activity and upregulation of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a hallmark of cardiac stress and DISEASE_D006333_heart_failure.
28759639	Inhibition of GRK2 improved cardiac function and survival and diminished DISEASE_D006331_cardiac_remodeling in various animal DISEASE_D006333_heart_failure models.
28759639	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of GRK2 on DISEASE_D006332_cardiac_hypertrophy and dissect potential molecular mechanisms.
28759639	In mice we observed increased GRK2 mRNA and protein levels following transverse aortic constriction (TAC).
28759639	Conditional GRK2 knockout mice showed attenuated DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophic response with preserved ventricular geometry 6 weeks after TAC operation compared to wild-type animals.
28759639	In isolated neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes stimulation with CHEMICAL_D000804_angiotensin_II and CHEMICAL_D010656_phenylephrine enhanced GRK2 expression leading to enhanced signaling via protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), consecutively inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b), such promoting nuclear accumulation and activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT).
28759639	Cardiac myocyte DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy induced by in vitro GRK2 overexpression increased the cytosolic interaction of GRK2 and CHEMICAL_18179_phosphoinositide 3-kinase y (PI3Ky).
28759639	Moreover, inhibition of PI3Ky as well as GRK2 knock down prevented Akt activation resulting in halted NFAT activity and reduced cardiac myocyte DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy.
28759639	Our data show that enhanced GRK2 expression triggers DISEASE_D006332_cardiac_hypertrophy by GRK2-PI3Ky mediated Akt phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of GSK3b, resulting in enhanced NFAT activity.
28765074	Estrogenic effects associated with CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_a exposure in SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) is associated with changes of endogenous CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol and gene specific DNA methylation levels.
28765074	The binding affinity of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors (ERs) is much lower than that of CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2), and whether there are other molecular mechanisms responsible for the estrogenic action of CHEMICAL__BPA in vivo currently remains unknown.
28765074	The objective of this study was to explore the potential association between the estrogenic effect induced by CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A in vivo and changes of endogenous E2 and gene specific DNA methylation levels.
28765074	After a waterborne exposure of SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish to 500, 1000, or 1500 g/L of CHEMICAL__BPA for 21d, GENE_101882735_vitellogenin (GENE_101882735_VTG) concentration in whole body homogenate, plasma E2 and CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone levels, hepatic ERs mRNA expressions, gonadal GENE_7955)_cyp19a1a and GENE_7955)_cyp17a1 mRNA expressions, and methylation levels of hepatic GENE_7955)_esr1 and gonadal GENE_7955)_cyp19a1a's promoters were determined.
28765074	Our results indicated that for the 500 and 1500 g/L treatment groups, GENE_101882735_VTG might be induced mainly by the elevated E2 levels; increases of E2 levels could be partly explained by the up-regulated expression of gonadal aromatase, mRNA levels of which were found to be negatively related to the methylation levels of both its promoter and one CHEMICAL__CpG site.
28765074	In addition, upon CHEMICAL__BPA exposure, hepatic GENE_2099_esr1 mRNA levels were also negatively related to the methylation levels of both its promoter and one CHEMICAL__CpG site.
28765074	These observations provide evidence for the non-ERs mediated mechanisms underlying the estrogenic action of CHEMICAL__BPA on SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28771573	Human leucocyte antigen (HLA-DR) gene expression is reduced in DISEASE_D018805_sepsis and correlates with DISEASE_D009336_impaired_TNFa response: A diagnostic tool for immunosuppression?
28771573	BACKGROUND: DISEASE_D018805_Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated immune response to infection.
28771573	Impaired immune response in DISEASE_D018805_sepsis, often described as endotoxin tolerance, is characterized by unresponsiveness of monocytes on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to release GENE_7124_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_7124_TNFa).
28771573	Furthermore, decreased monocyte surface protein expression of human leucocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) is a marker for changes of the innate immune response during DISEASE_D018805_sepsis.
28771573	Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and flow-cytometry (FACS) have been used to measure protein or gene expression of HLA-DR. We aimed to determine whether changes in mRNA expression of HLA-DR are associated with DISEASE_D009336_impaired_TNFa response in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D018805_sepsis.
28771573	METHODS: Surface protein together with mRNA expression of HLA-DR were measured by FACS and qPCR in a cohort of 9 DISEASE_D018805_sepsis SPECIES_9606_patients and compared to 10 pre-operative control SPECIES_9606_patients in a prospective study.
28771573	In addition, 20 SPECIES_9606_patients with post-surgical DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, 20 SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D018805_sepsis or DISEASE_D012772_septic_shock were included and GENE_7124_TNFa was determined following ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with 500 pg/mL LPS.
28771573	Total RNA was prepared from whole blood and subjected to qPCR analysis for expression analysis of GENE_3122_HLA_DR_alpha (GENE_3122_HLA_DRA) to correlate GENE_7124_TNFa response with GENE_3122_HLA_DRA expression.
28771573	RESULTS: SPECIES_9606_Patients with DISEASE_D018805_sepsis presented higher numbers of monocytes in peripheral blood (P<0.001) but decreased surface protein and mRNA HLA-DR levels when compared to controls.
28771573	In all SPECIES_9606_patients mRNA expression of GENE_3122_HLA_DRA was decreased by approximately 70% compared to controls (P<0.01) and was lowest in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D018805_sepsis or DISEASE_D012772_septic_shock (P<0.01).
28771573	GENE_7124_TNFa response to LPS was decreased in all SPECIES_9606_patients (median 319 pg/mL versus controls 1256 pg/mL; P<0.01) and lowest in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D018805_sepsis or DISEASE_D012772_septic_shock (median 128 pg/mL; P<0.01).
28771573	GENE_3122_HLA_DRA correlated positively with GENE_7124_TNFa response in all study SPECIES_9606_participants (r +0.60, P<0.001) and within SPECIES_9606_patients (r +0.67, P<0.001).
28771573	The GENE_7124_TNFa:GENE_3122_HLA_DRA ratio correlated negatively with severity and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (Spearman's rho -0.59, P<0.001).
28771573	CONCLUSION: In this study, GENE_3122_HLA_DRA expression was associated with a functional assay of the innate immune response.
28771573	Future interventional studies aimed at the immune response during DISEASE_D018805_sepsis could make use of these methods for optimizing target groups based on biological plausibility and intervention effectiveness.
28772150	Low-dose developmental exposure to CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A induces sex-specific effects in bone of Fischer 344 SPECIES_10116_rat offspring.
28772150	BACKGROUND: CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a component of CHEMICAL_61433_polycarbonate plastics to which SPECIES_9606_humans are regularly exposed at low levels, and an endocrine disruptor with effects on several hormonal systems.
28772150	Bone is a sensitive hormone target tissue, and we have recently shown that in utero and lactational exposure to 25  g CHEMICAL__BPA/kg BW/day alters femoral geometry in SPECIES_10116_rat offspring.
28772150	OBJECTIVE: To investigate bone effects in SPECIES_10116_rat offspring after developmental exposure to a CHEMICAL__BPA dose in the range of SPECIES_9606_human daily exposure (0.1-1.5  g/kg BW/day) as well as a dose to corroborate previous findings.
28772150	METHODS: Pregnant Fischer 344 SPECIES_10116_rats were exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA via drinking water corresponding to 0.5  g/kg BW/day: [0.5], (n=21) or 50  g/kg BW/day: [50], (n = 16) from gestational day 3.5 until postnatal day 22, while controls were given only vehicle (n = 25).
28772150	The offspring was sacrificed at 5 weeks of age.
28772150	Bone effects were analyzed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), the 3-point bending test, plasma markers of bone turnover, and gene expression in cortical bone and bone marrow.
28772150	RESULTS: Compared to controls, male offspring developmentally exposed to CHEMICAL__BPA had shorter femurs.
28772150	pQCT analysis revealed effects in the [0.5] group, but not in the [50] group; CHEMICAL__BPA reduced both trabecular area (-3.9%, p < 0.01) and total cross sectional area (-4.1%, p < 0.01) of femurs in the [0.5] group, whereas no effects were seen on bone density.
28772150	Conversely, bone length and size were not affected in female offspring.
28772150	However, the procollagen type I CHEMICAL__N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), a peptide formed during type 1 collagen synthesis, was increased in plasma (42%: p < 0.01) in female offspring exposed to [0.5] of CHEMICAL__BPA, although collagen gene expression was not increased in bone.
28772150	The biomechanical properties of the bones were not altered in either sex.
28772150	Bone marrow mRNA expression was only affected in male offspring.
28772150	CONCLUSIONS: Developmental low-dose exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA resulted in sex-specific bone effects in SPECIES_10116_rat offspring.
28772150	A dose approximately eight times lower than the current temporary EFSA SPECIES_9606_human tolerable daily intake of 4  g/kg BW/day, reduced bone length and size in male SPECIES_10116_rat offspring.
28772150	Long-term studies are needed to clarify whether the increased plasma levels of P1NP in female offspring reflect development of DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28780322	Reduction of oxidative damages induced by CHEMICAL_C009495_titanium_dioxide nanoparticles correlates with induction of the GENE_10090)_Nrf2 pathway by GSPE supplementation in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28780322	CHEMICAL_C009495_Titanium_dioxide nanoparticles (CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs) are widely used to additives in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, paints and foods.
28780322	Recent studies have demonstrated that CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs increased the risk of DISEASE_D009369_cancer and the mechanism might relate with oxidative stress.
28780322	Grape seed CHEMICAL_C017674_procyanidin extract (GSPE) is a natural compound which has been demonstrated to possess a wide array of pharmacological and biochemical actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and antioxidant properties.
28780322	Our data show that GSPE prevents the changes of histopathology and biomarkers in DISEASE_D006331_heart_liver_and_kidney that occur in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs.
28780322	After pretreatment with GSPE, the DNA damage, reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation and CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA) content in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 NPs had statistically significant decreases in dose dependent manners.
28780322	GSPE increased the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 (GENE_10090)_NF_E2_related_factor_2 (GENE_10090)_Nrf2), CHEMICAL_D009249_NAD_P_H dehydrogenase[CHEMICAL_D011803_quinine] 1(GENE_10090)_NQO1), CHEMICAL_D006418_heme oxygenase 1 (GENE_10090)_HO_1) and CHEMICAL_D018698_glutamate-CHEMICAL_D003545_cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GENE_10090)_GCLC).
28780322	We conclude that grape seed CHEMICAL_C017674_procyanidin extract prevents the majority of tissue and molecular damage resulting from nanoparticle treatment.
28780322	The protective effect of GSPE may be due to its strong antioxidative activities which related with the activated GENE_10090)_Nrf2 and its down-regulated genes including GENE_10090)_NQO1, GENE_15368;14629_HO_1_and_GCLC.
28780397	Neonatal exposure to a CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-based herbicide alters uterine decidualization in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28780397	We investigated whether defective modulation of uterine signaling may cause decidualization failure in SPECIES_10116_rats neonatally exposed to a CHEMICAL_C010974_glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH).
28780397	Female pups received vehicle or 2mg/kg of GBH from postnatal day (PND) 1 to PND7.
28780397	On PND8 and PND21, GENE_10116)_Wnt5a and b-catenin expression was evaluated in uterine samples.
28780397	On gestational day (GD) 9, GENE_10116)_Wnt5a, GENE_10116)_Wnt7a and b-catenin expression and GENE_10116)_Dkk1 and GENE_10116)_sFRP4 mRNA were evaluated on implantation sites.
28780397	On PND8, GBH-exposed SPECIES_10116_rats showed increased GENE_10116)_Wnt5a and b-catenin expression in luminal epithelium (LE), whereas on PND21, they showed increased GENE_10116)_Wnt5a and b-catenin expression in subepithelial stroma but decreased b-catenin expression in glandular epithelium.
28780397	On GD9, GBH-exposed SPECIES_10116_rats showed decreased GENE_10116)_Wnt5a and GENE_10116)_Wnt7a expression in the antimesometrial zone and LE respectively, without changes in b-catenin expression, while GENE_10116)_Dkk1 and GENE_10116)_sFRP4 were up- and down-regulated respectively.
28780397	We concluded that neonatal GBH exposure may lead to embryo losses by disturbing uterine signaling.
28774668	Chronic exposure of CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD) induces an obesogenic effect in C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet.
28774668	Contaminant involvement in the pathophysiology of DISEASE_D009765_obesity is widely recognized.
28774668	It has been shown that low dose and chronic exposure to endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs) potentiated diet- induced DISEASE_D009765_obesity.
28774668	High and acute exposure to CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD), a persistent organic pollutant (POP) and an EDC with anti-estrogenic property, causes DISEASE_D019282_wasting_syndrome .
28774668	However at lower doses, the CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD metabolic effects remain poorly understood.
28774668	We investigated the obesogenic effect during chronic exposure of CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD at 1 g/kg body weight (bw)/week in adult C57BL/6J mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD) and exposed from 10 to 42 weeks old to CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD or equal volume of vehicle by intragastric gavage.
28774668	Under these conditions, CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD was obesogenic in adult mice (7% in males and 8% in females), which was linked to fat mass.
28774668	A sex effect was observed in the fat mass distribution in adipose tissue and in the hepatic CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride content evolution.
28774668	In visceral fat pad weight, we observed a decrease (11%) in males and an increase (14%) in females.
28774668	The hepatic CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride content increase (41%) in females only.
28774668	CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD failed to induce any change in plasma parameters regarding CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose and lipid homeostasis.
28774668	Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels involved in adipose tissue and hepatic metabolism, inflammation, xenobiotic metabolism and endocrine disruption were differently regulated between males and females.
28774668	In conclusion, these results provide new evidence that CHEMICAL_28119_dioxin, a POP and EDC can be obesogenic for adult mice with multi-organ effects.
28774890	GENE_442906_MiR_338 controls CHEMICAL__BPA-triggered pancreatic islet GENE_3630_insulin secretory dysfunction from compensation to decompensation by targeting GENE_3651_Pdx_1.
28774890	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) can disrupt CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis and impair pancreatic islet function; however, the mechanisms behind these effects are poorly understood.
28774890	SPECIES_9606_Male SPECIES_10090_mice (4 wk old) were treated with CHEMICAL__BPA (50 or 500  g/kg/d) for 8 wk.
28774890	Whole-body CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis, pancreatic islet morphology and function, and GENE_442906_miR_338-mediated molecular signal transduction analyses were examined.
28774890	We showed that CHEMICAL__BPA treatment led to a disruption of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance and a compensatory increase of DISEASE_D010190_pancreatic_islets_insulin_secretion_and_pancreatic_and_duodenal_homeobox_1 (<i>GENE_10090)_Pdx1</i>) expression in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28774890	Inhibition of GENE_10090)_Pdx1 reduced CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose-stimulated GENE_3630_insulin secretion and CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP production in the islets of CHEMICAL__BPA-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28774890	Based on primary pancreatic islets, we also confirmed that GENE_442906_miR_338 regulated GENE_3651_Pdx1 and thus contributed to CHEMICAL__BPA-induced GENE_3630_insulin secretory dysfunction from compensation to decompensation.
28774890	Short-term CHEMICAL__BPA exposure downregulated GENE_442906_miR_338 through activation of G-protein-coupled CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor 1 (GENE_2852_Gpr30), whereas long-term CHEMICAL__BPA exposure upregulated GENE_442906_miR_338 through suppression of GENE_2740_glucagon_like_peptide_1_receptor (GENE_2740_Glp1r).
28774890	Taken together, our results reveal a molecular mechanism, whereby CHEMICAL__BPA regulates GENE_2852_Gpr30/GENE_2740_Glp1r to mediate the expression of GENE_442906_miR_338, which acts to control GENE_3651_Pdx1-dependent GENE_3630_insulin secretion.
28774890	The GENE_2852_Gpr30/GENE_2740_Glp1r-GENE_442906_miR_338-GENE_3651_Pdx1 axis should be represented as a novel mechanism by which CHEMICAL__BPA induces GENE_3630_insulin secretory dysfunction in pancreatic islets.-Wei, J., Ding, D., Wang, T., Liu, Q., Lin, Y. GENE_442906_MiR_338 controls CHEMICAL__BPA-triggered pancreatic islet GENE_3630_insulin secretory dysfunction from compensation to decompensation by targeting GENE_3651_Pdx_1.
28786057	Time-series analysis in CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib-resistant chronic DISEASE_D007951_myeloid_leukemia K562-cells under different drug treatments.
28786057	DISEASE_D015464_Chronic_myeloid_leukemia (DISEASE_D015464_CML) is characterized by the accumulation of active GENE_25_BCR_ABL protein.
28786057	CHEMICAL_C097613_Imatinib is the first-line treatment of DISEASE_D015464_CML; however, many SPECIES_9606_patients are resistant to this drug.
28786057	In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib-resistant DISEASE_D015464_CML cells under different drug treatments.
28786057	CHEMICAL__GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5).
28786057	Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: CHEMICAL_C006632_arsenic_trioxide (CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO), CHEMICAL_C498826_AMN107, and CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO+CHEMICAL_C498826_AMN107.
28786057	Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h).
28786057	Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM).
28786057	Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns.
28786057	Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
28786057	Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions.
28786057	Time-series genes in the CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO group (e.g.
28786057	GENE_890_CCNA2 and GENE_1601_DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the CHEMICAL_C498826_AMN107 group were related to cellular CHEMICAL_16646_carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO+CHEMICAL_C498826_AMN107 group (e.g.
28786057	SPECIES_10090_AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing.
28786057	In CHEMICAL_C097613_imatinib-resistant DISEASE_D015464_CML cells, CHEMICAL_C065179_ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, CHEMICAL_C498826_AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular CHEMICAL_16646_carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.
28782499	Antitumor activity of CHEMICAL__b_2_himachalen_6_ol in DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer is mediated through its inhibition of the GENE_10090)_PI3K and MAPK pathways.
28782499	Previous studies in our laboratory showed that SPECIES_4039_Daucus_carota oil extract (DCOE) possesses in  vitro and in  vivo anticancer activities.
28782499	Chemical analysis of DCOE led to the isolation of CHEMICAL__b_2_himachalen_6_ol (CHEMICAL__HC) which exhibited potent anticancer activity against DISEASE_D001943_colon_breast_brain_and_skin_cancer cells.
28782499	The present study investigates the anticancer activity of CHEMICAL__HC against SW1116 DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer cell lines, and evaluates its effect in a CHEMICAL_D019813_1_2_dimethylhydrazine (CHEMICAL_D004111_DMH) colon DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis black6 SPECIES_10090_mice model.
28782499	The SW1116 DISEASE_D003110_colon_cancer cell line was treated with SPECIES_9606_HC_1, 5, 10 and 25   g/ml) and cell viability was evaluated with WST 1 assay kit.
28782499	Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry, and pro/anti-apoptotic proteins were measured using western blot.
28782499	The effect of intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with CHEMICAL__HC (10, 25 and 50   g/ml) in SPECIES_10090_mice was assessed using the CHEMICAL_D004111_DMH colon DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis model with CHEMICAL_D002945_Cisplatin (2.5   g/kg; IP) as a positive control.
28782499	Blood samples were collected for assessment of liver DISEASE_D064420_toxicity and DISEASE_D003110_colon_tumor incidence and size were studied histologically.
28782499	CHEMICAL__HC showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell survival with an IC50 of 18 and 14.5   g/ml after 24 and 48  h respectively.
28782499	Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 10   g/ml CHEMICAL__HC increased the number of cells undergoing DISEASE_D009336_necrosis (18.05%) and late apoptosis (15.66%).
28782499	At CHEMICAL__HC 25   g/ml more cells shifted toward DISEASE_D009336_necrosis (58.01%) and late apoptosis (30.47%).
28782499	Western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in p-GENE_10090)_Erk, p-Akt, pro-caspase-3 and GENE_10090)_Bcl_2 and an increase in GENE_10090)_p53, GENE_10090)_p21, GENE_10090)_Bax and GENE_10090)_PARP proteins.
28782499	SPECIES_10090_Mice treatment (IP) with CHEMICAL__HC caused a significant decrease in DISEASE_D009369_tumor incidence and size.
28782499	Similar effects were observed with CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin treatment.
28782499	In conclusion, CHEMICAL__HC treatment (low dose) induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis via inhibition of the MAPK/GENE_10090)_ERK and GENE_10090)_PI3K/AKT pathways.
28782499	CHEMICAL__HC treatment also had antitumor effect in  vivo with no significant DISEASE_D064420_toxicity to laboratory SPECIES_10090_mice.
28785074	Low dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite confers resistance to UV induced apoptosis via GENE_7157_p53-GENE_4193_MDM2 pathway in ketatinocytes.
28785074	Chronic CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite and ultraviolet (UV) exposure are associated with DISEASE_D012878_skin_tumor.
28785074	To investigate the details by low concentrations of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite and UV induced DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis in skin, GENE_7015_hTERT-immortalized SPECIES_9606_human keratinocytes were used as a cellular model with exposure to low concentrations of CHEMICAL_C017947_sodium_arsenite and UV.
28785074	The effect of CHEMICAL_29678_NaAsO2 on UV treatment-induced apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and Hoechst staining.
28785074	We found that the cell apoptosis induced by UV exposure was significantly attenuated after exposure to low-dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite, and knockdown of GENE_7157_p53 could block UV-induced apoptosis indicating that this phenomenon depended on GENE_7157_p53.
28785074	Interestingly, the expression of SPECIES_10090_murine double minute 2 (GENE_10090)_MDM2), including its protein and transcriptional levels, was remarkably high after exposure to low-dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite.
28785074	Moreover, low-dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite treatment dramatically decreased the GENE_4193_MDM2 gene promoter activity, suggesting that this effect has been mediated through transcription.
28785074	In addition, treatment of CHEMICAL_C093973_PD98059 reversed low-dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced GENE_4193_MDM2 expression, and the inhibition of GENE_5594_ERK2 expression could significantly block GENE_4193_MDM2 expression as a consequence, and GENE_7157_p53 expression automatically was increased.
28785074	To validate the role of GENE_10116)_p53 in exposure to low-dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite, the expression of GENE_10116)_p53 was examined by immunohistochemistry in the skin of SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats model by chronic CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite exposure for 6 months and in SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D007642_arsenic_keratosis, and the results showed that the expression of GENE_7157_p53 was decreased in those samples.
28785074	Taken together, our results demonstrated that low-dose CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced resistance to apoptosis through GENE_7157_p53 mediated by GENE_4193_MDM2 in keratinocytes.
28789997	Environmentally relevant level of CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1 elicits toxic pro-inflammatory response in SPECIES_10090_murine CNS-derived cells.
28789997	CHEMICAL_D016604_Aflatoxin_B1 (CHEMICAL__AFB1) is a well-known member of CHEMICAL_D000348_aflatoxins (CHEMICAL__AFs) that is considered among highly stable toxic contaminants of food, worldwide.
28789997	The impact of CHEMICAL__AFB1 on neural cells and systems has poorly been understood.
28789997	To assess the cellular effects of CHEMICAL__AFB1 on brain, we used SPECIES_10090_murine pure primary astrocytes, sub ventricular zone-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) and microglia cell line (BV2).
28789997	Cells were exposed separately to environmentally relevant level (20ng/ml) of CHEMICAL__AFB1 for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48h in culture.
28789997	At each time points, total free radicals production measured by CHEMICAL_D008165_luminol-enhanced cellular chemiluminescence (CL) assay; cytokines production of GENE_10090)_IL_1b, GENE_10090)_IL_6, GENE_10090)_TNF_a and GENE_10090)_IL_10 were analyzed using Bioplex ELISA and a set of genes involved in the immediate response to danger such as GENE_10090)_TLR2, GENE_10090)_TLR4 and iNOS etc.
28789997	were evaluated by multiplex qPCR.
28789997	Upon CHEMICAL__AFB1 exposure production, of the total free radicals significantly increased only in microglial cells after 24h and slightly elevated in the other examined cells.
28789997	CHEMICAL__AFB1 also induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e.
28789997	GENE_10090)_TNF_a and GENE_10090)_IL_6) on both microglial cells (more GENE_10090)_TNF_a) and astrocytes (more GENE_10090)_IL_6).
28789997	mRNA expression of GENE_10090)_TLR2, GENE_10090)_TLR4, GENE_10090)_MyD88 and NF-kB were up-regulated with different timing and levels among cells.
28789997	Immunotoxicologically, microglial cells, and astrocytes, but not NPCs, are capable of sensing a low level of CHEMICAL__AFB1.
28789997	Thus, the pro-inflammatory effects of an environmentally relevant dose of CHEMICAL__AFB1 on CNS-derived cells in vitro could potentially explain the immune dysregulation in DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disorders.
28787001	CHEMICAL_C523798_YM155 as an inhibitor of DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness simultaneously inhibits autophosphorylation of GENE_1956_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor and G9a-mediated stemness in DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer cells.
28787001	Cancer stem cell survival is the leading factor for DISEASE_D009369_tumor recurrence after DISEASE_D009369_tumor-suppressive treatments.
28787001	Therefore, specific and efficient inhibitors of DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness must be discovered for reducing DISEASE_D009369_tumor recurrence.
28787001	CHEMICAL_C523798_YM155 has been indicated to significantly reduce stemness-derived tumorsphere formation.
28787001	However, the pharmaceutical mechanism of CHEMICAL_C523798_YM155 against DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness is unclear.
28787001	This study investigated the potential mechanism of CHEMICAL_C523798_YM155 against DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness in DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer.
28787001	Tumorspheres derived from GENE_1956_epidermal_growth_factor_receptor (GENE_1956_EGFR)-mutant SPECIES_9606_HCC827 and GENE_1956_EGFR wild-type A549 cells expressing higher DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness markers (GENE_8842_CD133, GENE_5460_Oct4, and Nanog) were used as DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness models.
28787001	We observed that GENE_1956_EGFR autophosphorylation (Y1068) was higher in HCC827- and A549-derived tumorspheres than in parental cells; this autophosphorylation induced tumorsphere formation by activating G9a-mediated stemness.
28787001	Notably, CHEMICAL_C523798_YM155 inhibited tumorsphere formation by blocking the autophosphorylation of GENE_1956_EGFR and the GENE_1956_EGFR-G9a-mediated stemness pathway.
28787001	The chemical and genetic inhibition of GENE_1956_EGFR and G9a revealed the significant role of the GENE_1956_EGFR-G9a pathway in maintaining the DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness property.
28787001	In conclusion, this study not only revealed that GENE_1956_EGFR could trigger tumorsphere formation by elevating G9a-mediated stemness but also demonstrated that CHEMICAL_C523798_YM155 could inhibit this formation by simultaneously blocking GENE_1956_EGFR autophosphorylation and G9a activity, thus acting as a potent agent against lung DISEASE_D009369_cancer_stemness.
28789951	Hepatoprotective activities of CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid against DISEASE_D001651_extrahepatic_cholestasis in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28789951	Though CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid possesses nutritional, pharmaceutical, and toxic properties and shows therapeutic potential on DISEASE_D008107_liver_diseases, its therapeutic effects against DISEASE_D008107_cholestatic_liver_diseases have not been proven.
28789951	Using an DISEASE_D001651_extrahepatic_cholestasis SPECIES_10116_rat model by bile-duct ligation (BDL), daily oral administration of CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid showed improvement effects on liver histology, serum biochemicals, ductular reaction, oxidative stress, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis.
28789951	CHEMICAL_C041376_Rosmarinic_acid alleviated BDL-induced transforming growth factor beta-1 (GENE_10116)_TGF_b1) production and hepatic collagen deposition, and the anti-fibrotic effects were accompanied by reductions in matrix-producing cells and GENE_29357;25631_Smad2_3.
28789951	BDL SPECIES_10116_rats showed increased hepatic GENE_10116)_NF_kB/SPECIES_10090_AP_1 activities, inflammatory cell infiltration/accumulation, and cytokine production, and these signs of DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_inflammation were ameliorated by CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid.
28789951	Mechanistic study revealed an inhibitory effect of CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid on the axis of the GENE_10116)_high_mobility_group_box_1 (GENE_10116)_HMGB1)/GENE_10116)_toll_like_receptor_4 (GENE_10116)_TLR4) in BDL SPECIES_10116_rats.
28789951	Results of cultured hepatic stellate cells further showed the impacts of CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid which attenuated GENE_10116)_TGF_b1-induced stellate cell mitogenic and fibrogenic activation.
28789951	Our findings support the concept that CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid could serve as a hepatoprotective agent, and dietary CHEMICAL_C041376_rosmarinic_acid supplementation may be beneficial in terms of improving DISEASE_D002779_cholestasis-related DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury via mechanisms involving resolution of oxidative burden and down-regulation of GENE_10116)_HMGB1/GENE_10116)_TLR4, GENE_10116)_NF_kB, GENE_10116)_AP_1, and GENE_10116)_TGF_b1/Smad signaling.
28795476	CHEMICAL_D010042_Ouabain impairs cell migration, and invasion and alters gene expression of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D012516_osteosarcoma SPECIES_9606_U_2_OS cells.
28795476	CHEMICAL_D010042_Ouabain, the specific CHEMICAL_D012964_Na_ /CHEMICAL_D011188_K_ -ATPase blocker, has biological activity including anti-proliferative and anti-DISEASE_D009362_metastasis effects in DISEASE_D009369_cancer cell.
28795476	There is no study to show CHEMICAL_D010042_ouabain inhibiting cell migration and invasion in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D012516_osteosarcoma SPECIES_9606_U_2_OS cells.
28795476	Thus, we investigated the effect of CHEMICAL_D010042_ouabain on the cell migration and invasion of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D012516_osteosarcoma SPECIES_9606_U_2_OS cells.
28795476	Results indicated that CHEMICAL_D010042_ouabain significantly decreased the percentage of viable cells at 2.5-5.0  M, thus, we selected 0.25-1.0  M for inhibiting studies.
28795476	CHEMICAL_D010042_Ouabain inhibited cell migration, invasion and the enzymatic activities of GENE_4313_MMP_2, and also affected the expression of GENE_284348_metastasis_associated_protein in SPECIES_9606_U_2_OS cells.
28795476	The cDNA microarray assay indicated that GENE_999_CDH1, GENE_7049_TGFBR3, GENE_53358_SHC3 and GENE_5608_MAP2K6 DISEASE_D009362_metastasis-related genes were increased, but GENE_595_CCND1, GENE_3725_JUN, GENE_1026_CDKN1A, GENE_7040;7042;7043_TGFB1_2_and_3, GENE_4089_SMAD4, GENE_4322_MMP13, GENE_4313_MMP2 and GENE_2335_FN1 genes were decreased.
28795476	These findings provide more information regarding CHEMICAL_D010042_ouabain inhibited cell migration and invasion and associated gene expressions in SPECIES_9606_U_2_OS cells after exposed to CHEMICAL_D010042_ouabain.
28801138	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium exposure in newborn SPECIES_10116_rats ovary induces DISEASE_D002658_developmental_disorders of primordial follicles and the differential expression of GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit gene.
28801138	Since the 1990s, the rising problem that gonad reproductive DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on adult female after exposing to CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium (CHEMICAL__Cd), an environmental endocrine disruptor, has attracted high attention at home and abroad,and was systematically studied.
28801138	Our research focuses on a further problem is that early CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium exposure (during birth to before puberty) impact on development and function of ovarian cells and its possible mechanism.
28801138	Our research focuses on the changes of ovarian cells growth and development after the newborn SPECIES_10116_rat ovaries with CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium exposure in vitro, and different expression of ovarian cells development-related factors, GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit and changes of their DNA methylation status.
28801138	We obtained ovaries from 4-day-old SD SPECIES_10116_rats and cultured them in DMEM/F12 mixed with a-MEM media in vitro.
28801138	Different doses of CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium were designed as control, 0.5, 5, 10 and 50 M, and then the constituent ratio of ovarian follicle and follicular oocytes diameter were observed with DISEASE_D046728_microscope after 4-h exposure.
28801138	We found that the increased constituent ratio of original follicle and decreased diameter of all levels of follicular oocytes(compared with control, with statistically significant differences, P<0.01).After the measurement of expression of GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting, the mRNA and protein expression of GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit in ovarian were both decreased.
28801138	We further found that the increased constituent ratio of growth follicle and increased diameter of oocytes under the treatment of adding GENE_10116)_SCF in cell culture media.
28801138	Finally, MALDI-TOF-MS method showed DNA-low methylation status of GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit promoter region after CHEMICAL__Cd exposure.
28801138	Overall, we concluded that the exposure of CHEMICAL__cadimium (5-50 M) on newborn SPECIES_10116_rats ovaries could inhibit follicle development.GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit system might mediate follicle development damage caused by CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium, which is associated with DNA hypomethylation of GENE_10116)_SCF/c-kit promoter region may be worthy of further study.
28796629	Hepatic Lipid Accumulation and GENE_10090)_Nrf2 Expression following Perinatal and Peripubertal Exposure to CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A in a SPECIES_10090_Mouse Model of DISEASE_D008107_Nonalcoholic_Liver_Disease.
28796629	BACKGROUND: Exposure to chemicals during critical windows of development may re-program liver for increased risk of DISEASE_D065626_nonalcoholic_fatty_liver_disease (DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD).
28796629	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), a plastics component, has been described to impart adverse effects during gestational and lactational exposure.
28796629	Our work has pointed to nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (GENE_4780_Nrf2) being a modulator of hepatic lipid accumulation in models of DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD.
28796629	OBJECTIVES: To determine if chemical exposure can prime liver for DISEASE_D005234_steatosis via modulation of GENE_4780_NRF2 and epigenetic mechanisms.
28796629	METHODS: Utilizing CHEMICAL__BPA as a model exposure, pregnant SPECIES_10090_CD_1_mice were administered 25 g/kg/day CHEMICAL__BPA via osmotic minipumps from gestational day 8 through postnatal day (PND)16.
28796629	The offspring were weaned on PND21 and exposed to same dose of CHEMICAL__BPA via their drinking water through PND35.
28796629	Tissues were collected from SPECIES_10090_pups at week 5 (W5), and their SPECIES_10090_littermates at week 39 (W39).
28796629	RESULTS: CHEMICAL__BPA increased hepatic lipid content concomitant with increased GENE_4780_Nrf2 and pro-lipogenic enzyme expression at W5 and W39 in female offspring.
28796629	CHEMICAL__BPA exposure increased GENE_4780_Nrf2 binding to a putative antioxidant response element consensus sequence in the CHEMICAL_15889_sterol regulatory-element binding protein-1c (<i>GENE_6720_Srebp_1c</i>) promoter.
28796629	Known GENE_4780_Nrf2 activators increased<i>GENE_6720_SREBP_1C</i>promoter reporter activity in HepG2 cells.
28796629	Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-PCR and pyrosequencing revealed that developmental CHEMICAL__BPA exposure induced hypomethylation of the<i>GENE_10090)_Nrf2</i>and<i>GENE_10090)_Srebp_1c</i>promoters in livers of W5 SPECIES_10090_mice, which was more prominent in W39 SPECIES_10090_mice than in others.
28796629	CONCLUSION: Exposure to a xenobiotic during early development induced persistent fat accumulation via hypomethylation of lipogenic genes.
28796629	Moreover, increased GENE_10090)_Nrf2 recruitment to the<i>GENE_10090)_Srebp_1c</i>promoter in livers of CHEMICAL__BPA-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice was observed.
28796629	Overall, the underlying mechanisms described a broader impact beyond CHEMICAL__BPA exposure and can be applied to understand other models of DISEASE_D065626_NAFLD.

28803762	CHEMICAL_D047310_Apigenin protects against CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury in SPECIES_10090_mice by regulating hepatic GENE_10090)_CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and GENE_10090)_PPARa-mediated lipogenic gene expression.
28803762	CHEMICAL_D000431_Alcohol is a major cause of DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury, and there are currently no ideal pharmacological reagents that can prevent or reverse this disease.
28803762	CHEMICAL_D047310_Apigenin is one of the most common CHEMICAL_D005419_flavonoids present in numerous plants and has many beneficial effects.
28803762	But whether or not CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin may protect against CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury remains unknown.
28803762	Our aim was to examine the effect and potential mechanisms.
28803762	The experimental SPECIES_10090_mice were given 56% erguotou wine or simultaneously given CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin 150-300  mg/kg by gavage for 30 days.
28803762	The results showed that in the CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin-treated SPECIES_10090_mice, the expression of hepatic GENE_10090)_cytochrome_P450_2E1 (GENE_10090)_CYP2E1) and nuclear factor kappa B proteins as well as contents of hepatic CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde and DISEASE_D009369_tumor necrosis factor-alpha were reduced, while the levels of hepatic reduced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione, GENE_10090)_glutathione_reductase, CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase, and GENE_10090)_glutathione_S_transferase were increased, especially in the 300  mg/kg group.
28803762	A significant change in DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis was also observed in the CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin 300  mg/kg group.
28803762	CHEMICAL_D047310_Apigenin pretreatment could increase the expression of hepatic GENE_10090)_peroxisome_proliferator_activated_receptor_alpha (GENE_10090)_PPARa) and CHEMICAL_D002331_carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 proteins, and decrease the expression of hepatic CHEMICAL_15889_sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid synthase, and CHEMICAL_41847_diacylglycerol acyltransferase proteins.
28803762	These findings demonstrated that CHEMICAL_D047310_apigenin might exert a protective effect on CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury, and its mechanisms might be related to the regulations of hepatic GENE_10090)_CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and GENE_10090)_PPARa-mediated lipogenic gene expression.
28804952	Evaluation of DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity of CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol and its related mechanism in DISEASE_D005909_glioblastoma cells and astrocytes.
28804952	CHEMICAL_D015742_Propofol (CHEMICAL_D015742_2_6_diisopropylphenol), one of the extensively and commonly used anesthetic agents, has been shown to affect the biological behavior of various models.
28804952	Previous researches have shown that CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol-induced DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity might cause anticancer effect in different cells.
28804952	However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol on DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity is still elusive in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D005909_glioblastoma cells.
28804952	The aims of this study were to evaluate effects of CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol on DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution and ROS production, and establish the relationship between oxidative stress and DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity in GBM 8401 SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D005909_glioblastoma cells and DI TNC1 SPECIES_10116_rat astrocytes.
28804952	CHEMICAL_D015742_Propofol (20-30  M) concentration-dependently induced DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and increased ROS production in GBM 8401 cells but not in DI TNC1 cells.
28804952	In GBM 8401 cells, CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol induced G2/M phase cell arrest, which affected the GENE_983_CDK1, GENE_891_cyclin_B1, GENE_7157_p53, and GENE_644914_p21 protein expression levels.
28804952	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol induced CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen stresses by increasing GENE_28893_O2_and_H2_O2 levels but treatment with the antioxidant CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC) partially reversed CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol-regulated antioxidative enzyme levels (CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase, GENE_847_catalase, and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase).
28804952	Most significantly, CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol induced apoptotic effects by decreasing GENE_596_Bcl_2 but increasing GENE_581_Bax, cleaved GENE_842_caspase_9/GENE_836_caspase_3 levels, which were partially reversed by CHEMICAL__NAC.
28804952	Moreover, the pancaspase inhibitor CHEMICAL__Z_VAD_FMK also partially prevented CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol-induced apoptosis.
28804952	Together, in GBM 8401 cells but not in DI TNC1 cells, CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol activated ROS-associated apoptosis that involved cell cycle arrest and caspase activation.
28804952	These findings indicate that CHEMICAL_D015742_propofol not only can be an anesthetic agent which reduces DISEASE_D010146_pain but also has the potential to be used for the treatment of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D005909_glioblastoma.
28806546	Parental exposure to CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A and its analogs influences zebrafish offspring immunity.
28806546	Transgenerational effects of environmental pollutants on humans and animals are complex.
28806546	Thus, we used zebrafish to evaluate the effects of parental whole-life cycle exposure to CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A and its analogs (CHEMICAL__bisphenol_S_and_F) on offspring innate immunity.
28806546	At adulthood, offspring were examined with/without continued chemicals treatment until 72h post-fertilization (hpf).
28806546	To measure offspring immune function, larvae at 72 hpf were expose for 24h with/without the viral mimic CHEMICAL__polyinosinic_cytidylic_acid (CHEMICAL_D011070_Poly_I_C) or the bacterial mimic CHEMICAL__Pam3Cys_Ser_Lys4 (PAM3CSK4).
28806546	Data show modified immunity in offspring.
28806546	Specifically, lysozyme activity was significantly induced in F1 larvae and respiratory burst response and oxidative defense genes were inhibited.
28806546	Genes of the innate immune system including Toll-like receptors and their downstream molecules and inflammatory cytokines were significantly down-regulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinases were up-regulated in larvae.
28806546	In addition, recombination-activating genes in the immature adaptive immune system were significantly reduced.
28806546	Thus, immune defense is diminished by exposing parental generations of zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentration of CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols and this suggests that fish chronically exposed to CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenols in the wild may be vulnerable to pathogens.
28807874	CHEMICAL_28125_Docosahexaenoic_acid increases the expression of GENE_29948_oxidative_stress_induced_growth_inhibitor_1 through the GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt/GENE_4780_Nrf2 signaling pathway in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28807874	GENE_29948_Oxidative_stress_induced_growth_inhibitor_1 (GENE_29948_OSGIN1), a DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor, inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell death.
28807874	N-6 and n-3 CHEMICAL_26208_PUFAs protect against DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer, but the molecular mechanisms of this effect are not clear.
28807874	We investigated the effect of n-6 and n-3 CHEMICAL_26208_PUFAs on GENE_29948_OSGIN1 expression and whether GENE_29948_OSGIN1 is involved in GENE_9933_PUFA-induced apoptosis in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28807874	We used 100   M of n-6 CHEMICAL_26208_PUFAs including CHEMICAL_D016718_arachidonic_acid, CHEMICAL_D019787_linoleic_acid, and CHEMICAL_D017965_gamma_linolenic_acid and n-3 CHEMICAL_26208_PUFAs including CHEMICAL_D017962_alpha_linolenic_acid, CHEMICAL_D015118_eicosapentaenoic_acid, and CHEMICAL_28125_docosahexaenoic_acid (CHEMICAL_16016_DHA).
28807874	Only CHEMICAL_16016_DHA significantly induced GENE_29948_OSGIN1 protein and mRNA expression.
28807874	CHEMICAL_16016_DHA triggered reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation and nuclear translocation of GENE_4780_Nrf2.
28807874	CHEMICAL_C085911_LY294002, a GENE_5293_PI3K inhibitor, suppressed CHEMICAL_16016_DHA-induced GENE_29948_OSGIN1 protein expression and nuclear accumulation of GENE_4780_Nrf2.
28807874	GENE_4780_Nrf2 knockdown attenuated CHEMICAL_16016_DHA-induced GENE_29948_OSGIN1 expression.
28807874	CHEMICAL_D000111_N_Acetyl_l_cysteine, a ROS scavenger, abrogated the CHEMICAL_16016_DHA-induced increases in GENE_207_Akt phosphorylation, GENE_4780_Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, and GENE_29948_OSGIN1 expression.
28807874	CHEMICAL_16016_DHA induced the GENE_581_Bax/GENE_596_Bcl_2 ratio, mitochondrial accumulation of GENE_29948_OSGIN1 and GENE_7157_p53, and GENE_54205_cytochrome_c release; knockdown of GENE_29948_OSGIN1 diminished these effects.
28807874	In conclusion, induction of GENE_29948_OSGIN1 by CHEMICAL_16016_DHA is at least partially associated with increased ROS production, which activates GENE_5293_PI3K/GENE_207_Akt/GENE_4780_Nrf2 signaling.
28807874	Induction of GENE_29948_OSGIN1 may be involved in CHEMICAL_16016_DHA-induced apoptosis in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28807876	Molecular insights on xenoestrogenic potential of CHEMICAL__zearalenone_14_glucoside through a mixed in  vitro/in silico approach.
28807876	The mycotoxin CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone may contaminate food and feed worldwide upon infections by Fusarium spp.
28807876	of plants and raw materials intended for SPECIES_9606_human and animal consumption.
28807876	Currently, contamination by CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone and congeners pose concern for health due to xenoestrogenic effects.
28807876	However, while CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone and the main reduced metabolites are well-known CHEMICAL__xenoestrogens, some plant metabolites that may enter the food chain have been observed aside.
28807876	Among them, CHEMICAL__zearalenone_14_glucoside may be abundant in the edible parts of infected plants, thereby entering significantly the SPECIES_9606_human diet and animal feeding.
28807876	On the basis of previous works, the lack of xenoestrogenicity for this compound per se was taken for granted, while neglecting the direct proof of estrogenic activity and considering the hydrolysis as a possible source of estrogenically active metabolites.
28807876	The present work investigated the xenoestrogenicity of CHEMICAL__zearalenone_14_glucoside, in comparison to CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone, deepening the underlying molecular mechanisms through an integrated in  vitro/in silico approach.
28807876	On the basis of our results, CHEMICAL__zearalenone_14_glucoside effectively stimulated a xenoestrogenic response in cells, but such stimulus can be entirely attributable to the hydrolysis phenomenon, as the glycosylated form turned out to be unable to effectively bind and activate the CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens receptors.
28808208	Effects of CHEMICAL_22901_bisphenol compounds on the growth and epithelial mesenchymal transition of MCF-7 CV SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28808208	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) has been considered as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) because it can exert estrogenic properties.
28808208	For CHEMICAL_C543008_bisphenol_S (CHEMICAL__BPS) and CHEMICAL__bisphenol_F (CHEMICAL__BPF) that are CHEMICAL__BPA analogs and substitutes, their risk to CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-dependent DISEASE_D009369_cancer has been reported rarely compared with the numerous cases of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28808208	In this study, we examined whether CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF can lead to the proliferation, migration, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MCF-7 clonal variant (MCF-7 CV) DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells expressing CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors (ERs).
28808208	In a cell viability assay, CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF significantly increased proliferation of MCF-7 CV cells compared to control (CHEMICAL_D004121_DMSO) as did CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2).
28808208	In Western blotting assay, CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF enhanced the protein expression of cell cycle progression genes such as GENE_595_cyclin_D1 and E1.
28808208	In addition, MCF-7 CV cells lost cell to cell contacts and acquired fibroblast-like morphology by the treatment of CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, or CHEMICAL__BPF for 24 hours.
28808208	In cell migration assay, CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF accelerated the migration capability of MCF-7 CV cells as did E2.
28808208	In relation with the EMT process, CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF increased the protein expression ofN-cadherin, while they decreased the protein expression of GENE_999_E_cadherin.
28808208	When CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF were co-treated with CHEMICAL_C070081_ICI_182_780, an ER antagonist, proliferation effects were reversed, the expression of GENE_595_cyclin_D1 and GENE_898_cyclin_E1 was downregulated, and the altered cell migration and expression ofN-cadherin and GENE_999_E_cadherin by CHEMICAL__BPA, CHEMICAL__BPS, and CHEMICAL__BPF were restored to the control level.
28808208	Thus, these results imply that CHEMICAL__BPS and CHEMICAL__BPF also have the risk of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer progression as much as CHEMICAL__BPA in the induction of proliferation and migration of MCF-7 CV cells by regulating the protein expression of cell cycle-related genes and EMT markersvia the ER-dependent pathway.
28803810	Autophagy plays a positive role in CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc-induced apoptosis in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
28803810	A high  -CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc (Zn) diet has been found to promote growth performance in SPECIES_9823_pigs, but causes cell apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium.
28803810	To investigate the mechanism underlying the high dietary Zn-induced apoptosis in porcine small intestinal epithelium, IPEC-SPECIES_9606_J2 cells (intestinal porcine epithelial cells) were used to determine the effect of Zn on cell inhibitory, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential and autophagy in vitro.
28803810	Results showed that Zn inhibited IPEC-SPECIES_9606_J2 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and autophagy.
28803810	High concentrations of Zn induced DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphological changes, and increased intracellular Zn concentration.
28803810	It also increased the protein expression level of cleaved caspase-3, GENE_841_caspase_8, GENE_8678_beclin_1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II, and the translocation of GENE_54205_cytochrome_c (GENE_54205_Cyto_C) into cytosol from mitochondria, and decreased the protein expression level of GENE_8878_P62/GENE_8878_SQSTM1.
28803810	While CHEMICAL_C025946_3_MA (CHEMICAL_C025946_3_methyladenine, as an autophagy inhibitor) suppressed the Zn-induced changes in the protein expression level of cleaved caspase-3 (GENE_836_CASP3), GENE_841_caspase_8 (GENE_841_CASP8), GENE_54205_Cyto_C, GENE_8678_beclin_1, LC3-II and GENE_8878_P62/GENE_8878_SQSTM1.
28803810	CHEMICAL_C025946_3_MA decreased the Zn-induced mitochondrial apoptosis.
28803810	High concentration of Zn up-regulated the relative mRNA expression level of GENE_581_BAX, GENE_54205_CYCS, GENE_836_CASP3, GENE_841_CASP8, GENE_8878_LC3_II_and_P62/GENE_8878_SQSTM1 genes (p<0.05), which were also ameliorated by CHEMICAL_C025946_3_MA supplementation.
28803810	In conclusion, autophagy inhibition significantly reduced the Zn-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuated the elevation of apoptosis in IPEC-J2.
28803810	Autophagy and apoptosis act as partners in the Zn-induced cellular death in IPEC-J2.
28804948	SPECIES_4432_Nelumbo_nucifera leaf extract treatment attenuated DISEASE_D011230_preneoplastic_lesions and oxidative stress in the livers of CHEMICAL_D004052_diethylnitrosamine-treated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28804948	Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn) possesses antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and anticancer potential.
28804948	This study determined the protective role of aqueous extract from SPECIES_4432_Nelumbo_nucifera leaves (NLE) against CHEMICAL__N_diethylnitrosamine (CHEMICAL_34873_DEN)-induced oxidative stress and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in a sample of SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28804948	NLE was fed orally to SPECIES_10116_rats in which DISEASE_D008113_hepatic_carcinoma was induced with CHEMICAL_34873_DEN for 12 weeks.
28804948	Five groups of 12 SPECIES_10116_rats each were used for the study: Group I (control group) SPECIES_10116_rats received distilled water; Group II SPECIES_10116_rats were induced with CHEMICAL_34873_DEN; Group III SPECIES_10116_rats were induced with CHEMICAL_34873_DEN and cotreated with 0.5% NLE; Group IV SPECIES_10116_rats were induced with CHEMICAL_34873_DEN and cotreated with 1.0% NLE; and Group V SPECIES_10116_rats were induced with CHEMICAL_34873_DEN and cotreated with 2.0% NLE.
28804948	Clinical chemistry, organ weight, inflammatory marker, protein expression, enzyme, and antioxidant analyses were conducted.
28804948	NLE administration to SPECIES_10116_rats resulted in significantly decreased levels of serum CHEMICAL_D000409_alanine aminotransferase, GENE_10116)_aspartate_aminotransferase, and albumin, which is indicative of hepatocellular damage, compared with the control group.
28804948	CHEMICAL_34873_DEN-induced oxidative stress was inhibited by NLE and this inhibition was paralleled by decreased lipid CHEMICAL_D010545_peroxides and increased CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione transferase, CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase, GENE_10116)_catalase, and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase activity in liver tissues.
28804948	The status of nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as CHEMICAL_D005978_reduced_glutathione, was also found to be increased in NLE-administered SPECIES_10116_rats.
28804948	Furthermore, NLE decreased DISEASE_D009369_tumor size, hepatic GENE_10116)_Rac1, GENE_10116)_PKCa, and GST   expressions compared with the CHEMICAL_34873_DEN-only group.
28804948	Thus, supplementation of NLE reduced the adverse changes that occur because of DISEASE_D008113_liver_cancer.
28804948	These results prove that NLE protects against DISEASE_D008107_liver_carcinogenesis induced because of treatment with CHEMICAL_34873_DEN through blocking lipid peroxidation, hepatic cell damage, and enhancing the antioxidant defense system.
28811679	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A Does Not Mimic CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen in the Promotion of the In Vitro Response of SPECIES_10090_Murine Dendritic Cells to Toll-Like Receptor Ligands.
28811679	Sex hormones affect immune responses and might promote DISEASE_D001327_autoimmunity.
28811679	Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) may mimic their immune effects.
28811679	Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are pivotal initiators of immune responses upon activation by danger signals coming from pathogens or distressed tissues through triggering of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
28811679	We generated in vitro SPECIES_10090_murine cDCs in the absence of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens and measured the effects of exogenously added CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen or CHEMICAL__BPA on their differentiation and activation by the TLR ligands DISEASE_C536528_LPS and CHEMICAL__CpG.
28811679	CHEMICAL_D004967_Estrogen enhanced the differentiation of GENE_10090)_GM_CSF-dependent cDCs from bone marrow precursors in vitro, and the selective CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) CHEMICAL_D013629_tamoxifen and CHEMICAL_C070081_fulvestrant blocked these effects.
28811679	Moreover, CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen augmented the upregulation of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12p70 and GENE_10090)_TNFa) upon stimulation by GENE_10090)_TLR9 ligand CHEMICAL__CpG, while the response to DISEASE_C536528_LPS was less CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-dependent.
28811679	These effects are partially explained by an CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-dependent regulation of GENE_10090)_TLR9 expression.
28811679	CHEMICAL__BPA did not promote cDC differentiation nor activation upon TLR stimulation.
28811679	Our results suggest that CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen promotes immune responses by increasing DC activation, with a preferential effect on GENE_10090)_TLR9 over GENE_10090)_TLR4 stimulation, and highlight the influence of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens in DC cultures, while CHEMICAL__BPA does not mimic CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen in the DC functions that we tested.
28807745	Acute DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of functionalized single wall CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon nanotubes: A biochemical, histopathologic and proteomics approach.
28807745	Recently CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed promising potentials in different biomedical applications but their safe use in SPECIES_9606_humans and probable DISEASE_D064420_toxicities are still challenging.
28807745	The aim of this study was to determine the acute DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of functionalized single walled CHEMICAL_D002244_carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).
28807745	In this project, PEGylated and Tween functionalized SWCNTs were prepared.
28807745	BALB/c SPECIES_10090_mice were randomly divided into nine groups, including PEGylated SWCNTs (75,150 g/mouse) and CHEMICAL_46793_PEG, CHEMICAL_D011136_Tween80 suspended SWCNTs, CHEMICAL_D011136_Tween_80 and a control group (intact SPECIES_10090_mice).
28807745	One or 7 days after intravenous injection, the SPECIES_10090_mice were killed and serum and livers were collected.
28807745	The oxidative stress markers, biochemical and histopathological changes were studied.
28807745	Subsequently, proteomics approach was used to investigate the alterations of protein expression profiles in the liver.
28807745	Results showed that there were not any significant differences in CHEMICAL__malondealdehyde (CHEMICAL_566274_MDA), CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH) levels and biochemical enzymes (ALT and AST) between groups, while the histopathological observations of livers showed some injuries.
28807745	The results of proteomics analysis revealed GENE_10090)_indolethylamine_N_Methyltransferase (GENE_10090)_INMT), GENE_10090)_glycine_N_Methyltransferase (GENE_10090)_GNMT), CHEMICAL_D012643_selenium binding protein (Selenbp), GENE_10090)_thioredoxin_peroxidase (GENE_10090)_TPx), GENE_10090)_TNF_receptor_associated_protein_1(GENE_10090)_Trap1), GENE_10090)_peroxiredoxin_6 (GENE_10090)_Prdx6), electron transport flavoprotein (Etf-a), GENE_10090)_regucalcin (Rgn) and GENE_10090)_ATP5b proteins were differentially expressed in functionalized SWCNTs groups.
28807745	Western blot analyses confirmed that the changes in GENE_10090)_Prdx6 were consistent with 2-DE gel analysis.
28807745	In summary, acute toxicological study on two functionalized SWCNTs did not show any significant DISEASE_D064420_toxicity at selected doses.
28807745	Proteomics analysis also showed that following exposure to functionalized SWCNTs, the expression of some proteins with antioxidant activity and detoxifying properties were increased in liver tissue.
28807765	GENE_10116)_SGLT2-inhibitor and GENE_10116)_DPP_4 inhibitor improve brain function via attenuating DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction, insulin resistance, DISEASE_D007249_inflammation, and apoptosis in HFD-induced DISEASE_D009765_obese SPECIES_10116_rats.
28807765	GENE_10116)_Dipeptidyl_peptidase_4 inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C502012_vildagliptin) has been shown to exert beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and neuroprotection in DISEASE_D009765_obese_insulin_resistance.
28807765	Recent studies demonstrated the neuroprotection of the CHEMICAL_D012964_sodium-CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C529054_dapagliflozin) in DISEASE_D003920_diabetes.
28807765	However, the comparative effects of both drugs and a combination of two drugs on DISEASE_D008659_metabolic_dysfunction and DISEASE_D001927_brain_dysfunction impaired by the DISEASE_D009765_obese_insulin_resistance have never been investigated.
28807765	Forty male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were divided into two groups, and received either a DISEASE_C537354_normal_diet (DISEASE_C537354_ND, n=8) or a high-fat diet (HFD, n=32) for 16weeks.
28807765	At week 13, the HFD-fed SPECIES_10116_rats were divided into four subgroups (n=8/subgroup) to receive either a vehicle, CHEMICAL_C502012_vildagliptin (3mg/kg/day) CHEMICAL_C529054_dapagliflozin (1mg/kg/day) or combined drugs for four weeks.
28807765	DISEASE_C537354_ND SPECIES_10116_rats were given a vehicle for four weeks.
28807765	Metabolic parameters and brain function were investigated.
28807765	The results demonstrated that HFD SPECIES_10116_rats developed DISEASE_D009765_obese_insulin_resistance and DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_decline.
28807765	CHEMICAL_C529054_Dapagliflozin had greater efficacy on improved peripheral insulin sensitivity and reduced weight gain than CHEMICAL_C502012_vildagliptin.
28807765	Single therapy resulted in equally improved brain mitochondrial function, insulin signaling, apoptosis and prevented DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_decline.
28807765	However, only CHEMICAL_C529054_dapagliflozin improved hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
28807765	A combination of the drugs had greater efficacy in improving DISEASE_D001927_brain_insulin_sensitivity and reducing brain oxidative stress than the single drug therapy.
28807765	These findings suggested that CHEMICAL_C529054_dapagliflozin and CHEMICAL_C502012_vildagliptin equally prevented DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_decline_in_the_obese_insulin resistance, possibly through some similar mechanisms.
28807765	CHEMICAL_C529054_Dapagliflozin had greater efficacy than CHEMICAL_C502012_vildagliptin for preserving synaptic plasticity, thus combined drugs could be the best therapeutic approach for neuroprotection in the DISEASE_D009765_obese_insulin_resistance.
28814068	The activation of GENE_10090)_NLRP3-inflammsome by stimulation of diesel exhaust particles in lung tissues from DISEASE_D004646_emphysema model and RAW 264.7 cell line.
28814068	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) lead to elevation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species, which can activate the CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family members containing the pyrin domain 3 (GENE_10090)_NLRP3)-inf lammasome.
28814068	In this study, we elucidated whether GENE_10090)_NLRP3 -inf lammasome is activated by DEPs and whether antioxidants (CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetylcysteine [CHEMICAL__NAC]) could inhibit such activation.
28814068	METHODS: RAW 264.7 cells and ex vivo lung tissues explants obtained from elastase-induced DISEASE_D004646_emphysema animal models were stimulated with DISEASE_188890_cigarette_smoking_extract (DISEASE_188890_CSE), DEPs, and lipopolysaccharide, and levels of GENE_10090)_interleukin_1b (GENE_10090)_IL_1b), GENE_10090)_caspase_1 and CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family members containing the pyrin domain (GENE_10090)_NLRP3)-inflammasome were assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
28814068	RESULTS: CHEMICAL__NAC and GENE_10090)_caspase_1 inhibitor suppressed DISEASE_188890_CSE- and DEP-induced secretion of GENE_10090)_IL_1b in RAW 264.7 cells.
28814068	The expression levels of the GENE_10090)_NLRP3-inflammasome and GENE_10090)_caspase_1 were upregulated in RAW 264.7 cells by stimulation with DISEASE_188890_CSE and DEPs and were inhibited by CHEMICAL__NAC.
28814068	DISEASE_188890_CSE and DEPs increased the secretion of GENE_10090)_IL_1b in lung tissues from both the normal and elastase-induced DISEASE_D004646_emphysema groups.
28814068	The secretion of GENE_10090)_IL_1b by DISEASE_188890_CSE and DEPs was increased in the elastin-induced DISEASE_D004646_emphysema group more than that in the normal group (DISEASE_188890_CSE: 309    19 pg/mL vs. 151    13 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.05; DEP: 350    24 pg/mL vs. 281    15 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.05).
28814068	CHEMICAL__NAC inhibited DISEASE_188890_CSE- and DEP-induced GENE_10090)_IL_1b secretion in both the normal and elastase-induced DISEASE_D004646_emphysema groups.
28814068	GENE_10090)_NLRP3-inflammasome expression as determined by immunohistochemistry was increased by DISEASE_188890_CSE and DEPs in both the normal and elastin-induced DISEASE_D004646_emphysema groups, and was suppressed by CHEMICAL__NAC.
28814068	CONCLUSIONS: The GENE_10090)_NLRP3-inf lammasome is activated by DEPs in ex vivo tissue explants from elastase-induced DISEASE_D004646_emphysema animal model, and this activation is inhibited by CHEMICAL__NAC.
28818685	CHEMICAL_D014520_Ethyl_carbamate induces cell death through its effects on multiple metabolic pathways.
28818685	CHEMICAL_D014520_Ethyl_carbamate (EC), a multisite carcinogenic chemical causing DISEASE_D009369_tumors in various animal species, is probably carcinogenic to humans.
28818685	However, information about the possible carcinogenic and toxicological effects of EC in humans is quite limited.
28818685	Because EC is found in many dietary foods (such as fermented foods) and tobacco and its products, and exposure of humans to EC often occurs inevitably, its toxicological effects in humans need to be studied.
28818685	This study was conducted to understand the metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in human DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma cells (HepG2) exposed to 100  mM  EC for short term (4  h) and long term (12  h) period, respectively.
28818685	The results revealed multiple influences of EC on the metabolome and transcriptome of HepG2 cells, which was exposure time-dependent and well correlated with the kinetic changes of cell viability and mortality.
28818685	EC treatment affected multiple metabolic pathways, inducing oxidative stress, reducing detoxification capacity, depleting energy, decreasing reducing power, disrupting membrane integrity, and damaging DNA and protein.
28818685	These metabolomic and transcriptomic biomarkers of EC on human cell metabolism identified in this study would facilitate further studies on the risk assessment and the mitigation of dietary EC.
28821999	Developmental DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity of the hippocampus following in utero exposure to CHEMICAL_30785_methylmercury: impairment in cell signaling.
28821999	In this study, we assessed some hippocampal signaling cascades and DISEASE_D001523_behavioral_impairments in 30-day-old SPECIES_10116_rat pups prenatally exposed to CHEMICAL_30785_methylmercury (CHEMICAL__MeHg).
28821999	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_rats were exposed to 1.0 or 2.0  mg/kg CHEMICAL__MeHg by gavage in alternated days from gestational day 5 until parturition.
28821999	We found increased DISEASE_D001008_anxiety-like and decreased exploration behavior evaluated by open field test and deficit of both short- and long-term memories by novel object recognition task, respectively, in CHEMICAL__MeHg-treated pups.
28821999	Downregulated PI3K/GENE_10116)_Akt/GENE_10116)_mTOR pathway and activated/hypophosphorylated (Ser9) GENE_10116)_GSK3b in CHEMICAL__MeHg-treated pups could be upstream of hyperphosphorylated Tau (Ser396) destabilizing microtubules and contributing to DISEASE_D008107_neural_dysfunction in the hippocampus of these SPECIES_10116_rats.
28821999	Hyperphosphorylated/activated p38MAPK and downregulated phosphoErk1/2 support a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade on CHEMICAL__MeHg DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28821999	Decreased receptor of advanced glycation end products (GENE_10116)_RAGE) immunocontent supports the assumption that downregulated GENE_10116)_RAGE/GENE_50689;116590_Erk1_2 pathway could be involved in hypophosphorylated CHEMICAL_25094_lysine/CHEMICAL_17822_serine/CHEMICAL_26271_proline (KSP) repeats on neurofilament subunits and disturbed axonal transport.
28821999	Downregulated GENE_10116)_myelin_basic_protein (GENE_10116)_MBP), the major myelin protein, is compatible with DISEASE_D003711_dysmyelination and neurofilament hypophosphorylation.
28821999	Increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels suggest reactive astrocytes, and active apoptotic pathways GENE_10116)_BAD/GENE_10116)_BCL_2, GENE_10116)_BAX/GENE_10116)_BCL_XL, and GENE_10116)_caspase_3 suggest cell death.
28821999	Taken together, our findings get light on important signaling mechanisms that could underlie the behavioral deficits in 30-day-old pups prenatally exposed to CHEMICAL__MeHg.
28823913	Dysregulation of DNA methylation and expression of imprinted genes in SPECIES_10090_mouse placentas of DISEASE_D005317_fetal_growth_restriction induced by maternal CHEMICAL_D002104_cadmium exposure.
28823913	CHEMICAL_D002104_Cadmium (CHEMICAL__Cd) is one of the most toxic environmental pollutants that cause DISEASE_D005315_fetal_malformation and growth restriction.
28823913	However, the molecular mechanisms underlying maternal CHEMICAL__Cd DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on fetal growth remain largely unknown.
28823913	Specifically, the expression profiles and the regulation mechanisms of the imprinted genes, have been poorly characterized in the etiology of CHEMICAL__Cd-induced DISEASE_D005317_fetal_growth_restriction (DISEASE_D005317_FGR).
28823913	In the present study, 13 imprinted genes associated with the fetal growth and placenta development were selected and their expression patterns were examined in the CHEMICAL__Cd-exposed placentas.
28823913	Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot results showed that the maternally expressed gene, GENE_1028_Cyclin_dependent_kinase_inhibitor_1c (GENE_1028_Cdkn1c), and paternally expressed gene, GENE_23089_Paternally_expressed_gene_10 (GENE_23089_Peg10), were significantly upregulated and downregulated respectively in the CHEMICAL__Cd-exposed placentas when compared to the normal ones respectively.
28823913	Moreover, data from bisulfate PCR demonstrated the changes of the methylation levels of the promoter regions of GENE_1028_Cdkn1c and GENE_23089_Peg10 in the CHEMICAL__Cd-exposed placentas.
28823913	In addition, the expression profile of GENE_1028_Cdkn1c was correlated with the methylation levels of site 2 (-837--692) but not site 1 (-389--185) of its promoter region.
28823913	Therefore, our results suggest that changes of the DNA methylation levels of the promoter regions and the expression patterns of GENE_1028_Cdkn1c and GENE_23089_Peg10 may be involved in the etiology of CHEMICAL__Cd-induced DISEASE_D005317_fetal_growth_restriction.
28822685	CHEMICAL__28_Homocastasterone down regulates blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol, CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides, SREBP1c and activates LxR expression in normal _ DISEASE_D003920_diabetic male rat.
28822685	Plant CHEMICAL_D013256_steroids are being recognized as influential secondary bio factors, assimilating in animal tissues through diet and affecting their cellular metabolic function to varying degree.
28822685	They modulate catalytic and signaling functions in mammalian cells, affecting cellular homeostasis.
28822685	The effect of phyto CHEMICAL__brassinosteroid_ketoisoform_28_homocastasterone (28-HC), was assessed for its influence on blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, plasma lipid and selective signal marker levels in normal and DISEASE_D003920_diabetic male wistar rat models.
28822685	A 15 day oral feed regimen employing the experimental rat, noted that circulating blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose, CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol and CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride level in DISEASE_D003920_diabetic rat were markedly reduced by this compound.
28822685	This study confirmed that the CHEMICAL__keto form had anti-DISEASE_D006944_hyperglycemic and anti-lipidemic potency associated with it and was available to man and animals in their diet.
28822685	Western blots of marker protein, PCR amplicons of marker mRNA expressions and In Silico studies suggested that 28-HCeffect is being mediated through LxR molecular operatives in the rat cell.
28823542	The DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) is negatively regulated by NF-kb p50 homodimers and involves histone 3 methylation/deacetylation in UROtsa cells chronically exposed to CHEMICAL_C406082_monomethylarsonous_acid.
28823542	UROtsa cells have been accepted as a model to study carcinogenicity mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-associated human DISEASE_D001749_bladder_cancer.
28823542	In vitro continuous exposure to CHEMICAL_C406082_monomethylarsonous_acid (DISEASE_C565390_MMA(III)), leads UROtsa cells to commit to malignant transformation.
28823542	In this process, NF-kb-associated inflammatory response seems to play an important role since this transcription factor activates some minutes after cells are exposed in vitro to DISEASE_C565390_MMA(III) and keeps activated during the cellular malignant transformation.
28823542	It is known that a slight decrease in the protein phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene expression is enough for some cells to become malignantly transformed.
28823542	Interestingly, this DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressor has been proven to be negatively regulated by NF-kb through binding to its gene promoter.
28823542	Based on these observations we propose that NF-kb may be involved in CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic associated DISEASE_D063646_carcinogenesis through the negative regulation of PTEN gene expression.
28823542	Changes in PTEN expression and the binding of p50 NF-kb subunit to PTEN promoter were evaluated in UROtsa cells exposed for 4, 12, 20, or 24 wk to 50nM CHEMICAL_C406082_MMA_III_.
28823542	Results showed that DISEASE_C565390_MMA(III) induced a significant decrease in PTEN expression around 20 wk exposure to CHEMICAL_C406082_MMA_III_,which correlated with increased binding of p50 subunit to the PTEN promoter.
28823542	Consistent with these results, ChIP assays also showed a significant decrease in H3 acetylation (H3ac) but an increase in the repression marks H3k9me3 and H327me3 in PTEN promoter when compared with not treated cells.
28823542	These results suggest that the activation of NF-kb by DISEASE_C565390_MMA(III) may participate in UROtsa cells malignant transformation through the negative regulation of PTEN expression involving p50 homodimers-mediated chromatin remodeling around the PTEN promoter.
28823652	PKC   -mediated CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_/NF-AT signalling pathway may be involved in T-cell immunosuppression in DISEASE_D002056_coal_burning_arsenic-poisoned population.
28823652	DISEASE_D020261_Arsenic_poisoning is a worldwide DISEASE_D004194_endemic_disease that affects thousands of people.
28823652	Growing evidence from animal, cell, and human studies indicates that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic has deleterious effects on the immune system.
28823652	The present investigation is a population-based study that observed changes in the proliferation of human T-cells and IL-2 and INF-y mRNA expression.
28823652	Our results show that DISEASE_D002056_coal_burning_arsenic can cause T-cell immunosuppression in the population, and participates in the occurrence and development of DISEASE_D020261_arsenic_poisoning.
28823652	In addition, we analyzed the intracellular CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium index, expression of protein kinase C theta (PKC   ) and phosphorylated PKC   , and the DNA-binding activity of NF-AT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
28823652	Our analysis demonstrates that the PKC   -mediated CHEMICAL_29108_Ca_2_/NF-AT signalling pathway may be involved in the T-cell immunosuppression of DISEASE_D002056_coal_burning_arsenic-poisoned population.
28823652	This study provides important data for a mechanistic understanding of DISEASE_D020261_endemic_arsenic_poisoning.
28825726	A mutational signature reveals alterations underlying deficient homologous recombination repair in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28825726	Biallelic inactivation of GENE_672_BRCA1 or GENE_675_BRCA2 is associated with a pattern of genome-wide mutations known as signature 3.
28825726	By analyzing    1,000 DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer samples, we confirmed this association and established that germline nonsense and frameshift variants in GENE_79728_PALB2, but not in GENE_472_ATM or GENE_11200_CHEK2, can also give rise to the same signature.
28825726	We were able to accurately classify missense GENE_672_BRCA1 or GENE_675_BRCA2 variants known to impair homologous recombination (HR) on the basis of this signature.
28825726	Finally, we show that epigenetic silencing of GENE_5889_RAD51C and GENE_672_BRCA1 by promoter methylation is strongly associated with signature 3 and, in our data set, was highly enriched in basal-like DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancers in young individuals of African descent.
28825729	A SPECIES_9606_Children's Oncology Group and TARGET initiative exploring the genetic landscape of DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumor.
28825729	We performed genome-wide sequencing and analyzed mRNA and miRNA expression, DNA copy number, and DNA methylation in 117 DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumors, followed by targeted sequencing of 651 DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumors.
28825729	In addition to genes previously implicated in DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumors (GENE_7490_WT1, GENE_1499_CTNNB1, GENE_139285_AMER1, GENE_29102_DROSHA, GENE_54487_DGCR8, GENE_57510_XPO5, GENE_23405_DICER1, GENE_6495_SIX1, GENE_10736_SIX2, GENE_4298_MLLT1, GENE_4613_MYCN, and GENE_7157_TP53), we identified mutations in genes not previously recognized as recurrently involved in DISEASE_D009396_Wilms_tumors, the most frequent being GENE_54880_BCOR, GENE_63035_BCORL1, GENE_4841_NONO, MAX, GENE_1293_COL6A3, GENE_171023_ASXL1, GENE_4216_MAP3K4, and GENE_8289_ARID1A.
28825729	DNA copy number changes resulted in recurrent 1q gain, GENE_4613_MYCN amplification, DISEASE_D015430_LIN28B_gain, and MIRLET7A loss.
28825729	Unexpected germline variants involved GENE_79728_PALB2 and GENE_11200_CHEK2.
28825729	Integrated analyses support two major classes of genetic changes that preserve the progenitor state and/or interrupt normal development.
28826779	Gene expression profiles in auricle skin as a possible additional endpoint for determination of sensitizers: A multi-endpoint evaluation of the local lymph node assay.
28826779	The SPECIES_10090_murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is widely used to test chemicals to induce DISEASE_D012871_skin_sensitization.
28826779	Exposure of SPECIES_10090_mouse auricle skin to a sensitizer results in proliferation of local lymph node T cells, which has been measured by in vivo incorporation of CHEMICAL__H_3_methyl_thymidine or CHEMICAL_D001973_5_bromo_2_deoxyuridine (CHEMICAL_D001973_BrdU).
28826779	The stimulation index (SI), the ratio of the mean proliferation in each treated group to that in the concurrent vehicle control group, is frequently used as a regulatory-authorized endpoint for LLNA.
28826779	However, some non-sensitizing irritants, such as CHEMICAL_D012967_sodium_dodecyl_sulfate (CHEMICAL_8984_SDS) or CHEMICAL_C033069_methyl_salicylate (DISEASE_C535434_MS), have been reported as false-positives by this endpoint.
28826779	In search of a potential endpoint to enhance the specificity of existing endpoints, we evaluated 3 contact sensitizers; (CHEMICAL_C080043_hexyl_cinnamic_aldehyde [CHEMICAL__HCA], CHEMICAL_D010081_oxazolone [CHEMICAL_C015692_OXA], and CHEMICAL_34718_2_4_dinitrochlorobenzene [CHEMICAL_D004137_DNCB]), 1 respiratory sensitizer (CHEMICAL_D014051_toluene_2_4_diisocyanate [CHEMICAL_53557_TDI]), and 2 non-sensitizing irritants (DISEASE_C535434_MS and CHEMICAL_8984_SDS) by several endpoints in LLNA.
28826779	Each test substance was applied to both ears of female CBA/Ca SPECIES_10090_mice daily for 3 consecutive days.
28826779	The ears and auricle lymph node cells were analyzed on day 5 for endpoints including the SI value, lymph node cell count, cytokine release from lymph node cells, and histopathological changes and gene expression profiles in auricle skin.
28826779	The SI values indicated that all the test substances induced significant proliferation of lymph node cells.
28826779	The lymph node cell counts showed no significant changes by the non-sensitizers assessed.
28826779	The inflammatory findings of histopathology were similar among the auricle skins treated by sensitizers and irritants.
28826779	Gene expression profiles of cytokines IFN-y, GENE_10090)_IL_4, and GENE_10090)_IL_17 in auricle skin were similar to the cytokine release profiles in draining lymph node cells.
28826779	In addition, the gene expression of the chemokine GENE_10090)_CXCL1 and/or GENE_10090)_CXCL2 showed that it has the potential to discriminate sensitizers and non-sensitizing irritants.
28826779	Our results suggest that multi-endpoint analysis in the LLNA leads to a better determination of the sensitizing potential of test substances.
28826779	We also show that the gene expression of GENE_10090)_CXCL1 and/or GENE_10090)_CXCL2, which is involved in elicitation of DISEASE_D004342_contact_hypersensitivity (DISEASE_D004342_CHS), can be a possible additional endpoint for discrimination of sensitizing compounds in LLNA.
28826906	CHEMICAL_D000535_Aluminum exposure at SPECIES_9606_human dietary levels promotes DISEASE_D014652_vascular_dysfunction and increases blood pressure in SPECIES_10116_rats: A concerted action of CHEMICAL_D009249_NAD_P_H oxidase and GENE_10116)_COX_2.
28826906	CHEMICAL_D000535_Aluminum (CHEMICAL__Al) is a non-essential metal and a significant environmental contaminant and is associated with a number of SPECIES_9606_human diseases including DISEASE_D002318_cardiovascular_disease.
28826906	We investigated the effects of CHEMICAL__Al exposure at doses similar to SPECIES_9606_human dietary levels on the cardiovascular system over a 60day period.
28826906	Wistar SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10116_rats were divided into two major groups and received orally: 1) Low CHEMICAL_D000535_aluminum level - SPECIES_10116_rats were subdivided and treated for 60days as follows: a) Untreated - ultrapure water; b) CHEMICAL_C010845_AlCl3 at a dose of 8.3mg/kg bw for 60days, representing SPECIES_9606_human CHEMICAL__Al exposure by diet; and 2) High CHEMICAL_D000535_aluminum level - SPECIES_10116_rats were subdivided and treated for 42days as follows: C) Untreated - ultrapure water; d) CHEMICAL_C010845_AlCl3 at 100mg/kg bw for 42days, representing a high level of SPECIES_9606_human exposure to CHEMICAL__Al.
28826906	Effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and vascular function of aortic and mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) were studied.
28826906	Endothelium and smooth muscle integrity were evaluated by concentration-response curves to CHEMICAL_D000109_acetylcholine (CHEMICAL_D000109_ACh) and CHEMICAL_D009599_sodium_nitroprusside.
28826906	Vasoconstrictor responses to CHEMICAL_D010656_phenylephrine (CHEMICAL_28044_Phe) in the presence and absence of endothelium and in the presence of the GENE_4843_NOS inhibitor CHEMICAL_D019331_L_NAME, the CHEMICAL_D011188_potassium channels blocker CHEMICAL_D013662_TEA, the CHEMICAL_D009249_NAD_P_H oxidase inhibitor CHEMICAL_C056165_apocynin, CHEMICAL_D013481_superoxide dismutase (GENE_6647_SOD), the non-selective COX inhibitor CHEMICAL_D007213_indomethacin and the selective GENE_4513_COX_2 inhibitor CHEMICAL_C080955_NS_398 were analyzed.
28826906	Vascular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity, were measured.
28826906	The mRNA expressions of eNOS, CHEMICAL_D009249_NAD_P_H oxidase 1 and 2, GENE_6647_SOD1, GENE_4513_COX_2 and GENE_6915_thromboxane_A2_receptor (GENE_6915_TXA_2_R) were also investigated.
28826906	CHEMICAL__Al exposure at SPECIES_9606_human dietary levels impaired the cardiovascular system and these effects were almost the same as CHEMICAL__Al exposure at much higher levels.
28826906	CHEMICAL__Al increased SBP, decreased CHEMICAL_D000109_ACh-induced relaxation, increased response to CHEMICAL_28044_Phe, decreased endothelial modulation of vasoconstrictor responses, the bioavailability of CHEMICAL_D009569_nitric_oxide (NO), the involvement of CHEMICAL_D011188_potassium channels on vascular responses, as well as increased ROS production from CHEMICAL_D009249_NAD_P_H oxidase and contractile prostanoids mainly from GENE_4513_COX_2 in both aorta and mesenteric arteries.
28826906	CHEMICAL__Al exposure increased vascular ROS production and lipid peroxidation as well as altered the antioxidant status in aorta and MRA.
28826906	CHEMICAL__Al decreased vascular eNOS and GENE_6647_SOD1 mRNA levels and increased the GENE_27035_NAD_P_H_oxidase_1, GENE_4513_COX_2 and GENE_6915_TXA_2_R mRNA levels.
28826906	Our results point to an excess of ROS mainly from CHEMICAL_D009249_NAD_P_H oxidase after CHEMICAL__Al exposure and the increased vascular CHEMICAL_D011453_prostanoids from GENE_4513_COX_2 acting in concert to decrease NO bioavailability, thus inducing DISEASE_D014652_vascular_dysfunction and increasing blood pressure.
28826906	Therefore, 60-day chronic exposure to CHEMICAL__Al, which reflects common SPECIES_9606_human dietary CHEMICAL__Al intake, appears to pose a risk for the cardiovascular system.
28833918	Attenuation of DNA damage and mRNA gene expression in DISEASE_D000860_hypoxic SPECIES_10116_rats using natural antioxidants.
28833918	This study aimed to explore the efficiency of CHEMICAL_D002336_carnosine (CHEMICAL__Cs) and/or CHEMICAL_D001120_l_arginine (CHEMICAL_9141_Agn) in the downregulation of apoptotic and inflammatory molecule expression and DNA damage caused DISEASE_D056486_hepatic_injury in response to CHEMICAL_D012977_sodium_nitrite (CHEMICAL__Sd)-induced DISEASE_D000860_hypoxia in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28833918	SPECIES_10116_Rats were injected with CHEMICAL__Sd; CHEMICAL_9141_Agn or/and CHEMICAL__Cs were administrated prior to CHEMICAL__Sd intoxication.
28833918	CHEMICAL__Sd significantly decreased hemoglobin concentration and GENE_596_Bcl_2 mRNA expression, while increased expressions of apoptotic markers (GENE_581_Bax and caspase), DISEASE_D009369_tumor DISEASE_D009336_necrosis factor-a, nuclear factor kappa B, and GENE_1401_C_reactive_protein and the oxidative DNA damage in hepatic tissue.
28833918	Moreover, administration of CHEMICAL_9141_Agn or/and CHEMICAL__Cs exhibited a modulation of the previous parameters.
28833918	However, concurrent treatment with the forementioned antioxidants modulated these levels.
28833918	It was concluded that the treatment with the combination of CHEMICAL_9141_Agn and CHEMICAL__Cs was the most effective regimen in ameliorating CHEMICAL__Sd DISEASE_D064420_toxicity accompanied by DISEASE_D000860_hypoxic stress.
28834734	CHEMICAL__ONTD induces DISEASE_D006130_growth_arrest and apoptosis of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D006528_hepatoma Bel-7402 cells though a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y-dependent pathway.
28834734	CHEMICAL__ONTD (CHEMICAL_C581004_3_Oxo_29_noroleana_1_9_11_12_trien_2_20_dicarbonitrile) is a novel synthetic derivative of CHEMICAL_D006034_glycyrrhetinic_acid (GA), which has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor activities through its mechanisms are not fully understood.
28834734	Previously, we demonstrated that CHEMICAL__ONTD induces apoptosis of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D006528_hepatoma cells via a MAPK-dependent mitochondrial pathway.
28834734	Recently, CHEMICAL__ONTD was found to increase sub-G1 accumulation and GENE_308_Annexin_V positive staining, indicating apoptotic induction effect.
28834734	It was also be found that CHEMICAL__ONTD increase the GENE_5465_PPAR-y activity, reduce the phosphorylation of Akt and increase GENE_5728_phosphatase_and_tensin_homologue (GENE_5728_PTEN) protein expression in DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC) Bel-7402 cells, and these were associated with the inhibition of cells proliferation.
28834734	More importantly, these effects could be diminished by CHEMICAL_C457499_GW9662, a specific GENE_5465_PPAR-y antagonist, suggesting that CHEMICAL__ONTD can act as a ligand of GENE_5465_PPAR-y.
28834734	Taken together, our novel observations suggested that CHEMICAL__ONTD may have potential implication in DISEASE_D006528_HCC prevention and treatment, and showed for the first time that the anti-DISEASE_D009369_tumor effect of CHEMICAL__ONTD may also be mediated through modulation of the GENE_5465_PPAR-y activation and mediated by the GENE_5728_PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.
28834734	The present study also supports CHEMICAL__ONTD as a potential drug candidate for chemoprevention or chemotherapy of DISEASE_D006528_HCC.
28834696	CHEMICAL_C010059_Semicarbazide disturbs the reproductive system of male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish (SPECIES_7955_Danio_rerio) through the GABAergic system.
28834696	CHEMICAL_C010059_Semicarbazide (CHEMICAL__SMC), an emerging water contaminant, exerts anti-estrogenic effects in female SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28834696	However, the exact influence of CHEMICAL__SMC on male reproduction remains unclear.
28834696	In this study, adult male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish were exposed to 1-1000 g/L CHEMICAL__SMC in a semi-static system for 28 d prior to examining the testicular somatic index (TSI), testis histology, plasma sex hormone levels, and the transcription of genes involved in reproduction.
28834696	The results showed that testicular morphology was altered and TSI was down-regulated by high concentrations of CHEMICAL__SMC (>= 100 g/L and 1000 g/L, respectively).
28834696	Plasma CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone and CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol concentrations were significantly decreased by all of the CHEMICAL__SMC treatments, along with down-regulation of the corresponding steroidogenic gene transcripts.
28834696	These changes were associated with the inhibition of CHEMICAL_D005680_gamma_aminobutyric_acid synthesis and function, in addition to the decreased expression of reproductive regulators.
28834696	Our results contribute to elucidating the mechanisms underlying the adverse reproductive effects of CHEMICAL__SMC in male SPECIES_7955_zebrafish.
28842171	CHEMICAL_D003091_Colistin-induced autophagy and apoptosis involves the JNK-Bcl2-Bax signaling pathway and JNK-p53-ROS positive feedback loop in PC-12 cells.
28842171	Our recent study demonstrated DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity of CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced autophagy and apoptosis in PC-12  cells, and that autophagy reached peak level at 12  h. In this study, we scrutinized the role of JNK in CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity and demonstrated the relationship among JNK, p53 and ROS in CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin treated PC-12  cells.
28842171	CHEMICAL_D003091_Colistin-induced autophagy and apoptosis by JNK inhibition/activation were examined by western blotting, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence/fluorescence microscopy.
28842171	The results indicated that CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin induced JNK activation reached peak level at 12  h, while the highest levels of p-Bcl2/Bcl2 were observed at 12  h and Bax/Bcl2 significantly increased in a time-dependent manner.
28842171	In PC-12  cells, inhibition of JNK by CHEMICAL_C432165_SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) resulted in significantly lower levels of autophagy upon CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin treatment, depending on the expression levels of Beclin1, LC3-II, p62 degradation and reduction in the number of autophagic vacuoles.
28842171	In contrast, CHEMICAL_D000841_anisomycin pretreatment PC-12  cells led to upregulated autophagy.
28842171	Especially, the highest levels of Beclin1 and p-Bcl2/Bcl2 were observed at 6  h, and Bax/Bcl2, cleaved-caspase3 and cleaved-PARP significantly increased in a time-dependent manner.
28842171	The results revealed that JNK activation mediated autophagy and apoptosis related to Beclin1-Bcl2 and Bax-Bcl2 complex in CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-treated PC-12  cells.
28842171	Silencing of p53 by siRNA before CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin treatment substantially reduced ROS production and transactivated JNK in PC-12  cells.
28842171	Moreover, activation of JNK increased ROS generation in PC-12  cells.
28842171	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_D003091_colistin-induced autophagy and apoptosis is correlated to JNK-Bcl2-Bax signaling pathway, and an interaction effect found between intracellular ROS level and JNK-p53 signaling pathway in apoptosis.
28842383	GENE_10116)_Glucagon_like_peptide_2 prevents down-regulation of intestinal GENE_10116)_multidrug_resistance_associated_protein_2 and GENE_10116)_P_glycoprotein in endotoxemic SPECIES_10116_rats.
28842383	GENE_1244_Multidrug_resistance_associated_protein_2 (GENE_1244_Mrp2, GENE_1244_ABCC2) and GENE_5243_P_glycoprotein (GENE_5243_P_gp, GENE_5243_ABCB1) constitute essential components of the intestinal biochemical barrier that prevent incorporation of food contaminants, drugs or toxic metabolites into the blood stream.
28842383	DISEASE_D019446_Endotoxemia induced in SPECIES_10116_rats by administration of SPECIES_2_bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in elevated intestinal permeability and DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of xenobiotics in part associated with down-regulation of expression and activity of GENE_10116)_Mrp2 and GENE_10116)_P_gp.
28842383	We evaluated the protective effect of GENE_10116)_glucagon_like_peptide_2 (GENE_10116)_GLP_2), a peptide hormone with enterotrophic properties, on GENE_10116)_Mrp2 and GENE_10116)_P_gp alterations induced by single i.p.
28842383	injection of LPS (5mg/kg b.wt.)
28842383	to SPECIES_10116_rats.
28842383	Two different protocols of GENE_2641_GLP_2 administration, namely prevention and reversion, were examined.
28842383	The prevention protocol consisted of 7s.c.
28842383	injections of GENE_2641_GLP_2 (125 g/kg b.wt.)
28842383	administered every 12h, starting 60h before LPS administration.
28842383	The reversion protocol consisted of 2 doses of GENE_2641_GLP_2, starting 3h after LPS injection.
28842383	Intestinal samples were collected 24h after LPS administration and expression (protein and mRNA) and activity of GENE_1244_Mrp2 were evaluated in proximal jejunum whereas those of GENE_5243_P_gp were studied in ileum.
28842383	GENE_2641_GLP_2 completely neutralized down-regulation of expression of GENE_1244_Mrp2 and GENE_5243_P_gp and loss of their respective activities induced by LPS under prevention protocol.
28842383	GENE_2641_GLP_2 was also able to prevent internalization of both transporters from the apical membrane of the enterocyte to intracellular compartments, as detected by confocal microscopy.
28842383	LPS induced an increase in GENE_3553_IL_1b and oxidized CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione tissue levels, which were also counterbalanced by GENE_2641_GLP_2 administration.
28842383	In contrast, the reversion protocol failed to attenuate GENE_1244_Mrp2 and GENE_5243_P_gp down-regulation induced by LPS.
28842383	We conclude that GENE_10116)_GLP_2 can prevent down-regulation of intestinal expression and activity of GENE_10116)_Mrp2 and GENE_10116)_P_gp in endotoxemic SPECIES_10116_rats and that GENE_10116)_IL_1b and oxidative stress constitute potential targets of GENE_10116)_GLP_2 protective effects.
28843478	Chronic CHEMICAL_D000431_alcohol consumption regulates the expression of poly immunoglobulin receptor (GENE_5284_pIgR) and secretory IgA in the gut.
28843478	The effect of CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol (EtOH) on the gut immune system was analyzed using an experimental model previously described, where EtOH was provided ad libitum in the drinking water in a 20% w/v concentration for up to 12weeks.
28843478	Dendritic cells, T cells and macrophages were analyzed in Peyer's patches and the small intestines using flow cytometry.
28843478	Cytokine and immunoglobulin levels were analyzed in sera, feces, and homogenates from small and large intestines and lungs.
28843478	Decreases in the proportion of T cells and alterations in dendritic cells and macrophages were observed after EtOH treatment.
28843478	Levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) increased in tissue homogenates but decreased in small intestine fecal contents.
28843478	Meanwhile GENE_5284_poly_immunoglobulin_receptor (GENE_5284_pIgR) levels decreased in tissue homogenates and fecal contents.
28843478	Levels of cytokines associated with the regulation of GENE_5284_pIgR expression decreased for GENE_3586_IL_10 and GENE_7040_TGF_b, and increased for GENE_3458_IFN_y and GENE_3605_IL_17 in the small intestine.
28843478	The data indicate that chronic EtOH consumption disrupts the homeostasis of the mucosal immune system by altering the phenotype and functionality of multiple immune cell types, leading to a diminished secretion of SIgA, due to GENE_5284_pIgR expression decreased.
28843594	Safety assessment of the dietary supplement OxyELITE    Pro (New Formula) in inbred and outbred SPECIES_10090_mouse strains.
28843594	Herbal dietary supplements have gained wide acceptance as alternatives to conventional therapeutic agents despite concerns regarding their efficacy and safety.
28843594	In 2013, a spate of severe DISEASE_D056486_liver_injuries across the United States was linked to the dietary supplement OxyELITE Pro-New Formula (OEP-NF), a multi-ingredient product marketed for weight loss and exercise performance enhancement.
28843594	The principal goal of this study was to assess the hepatotoxic potential of OEP-NF in outbred and inbred SPECIES_10090_mouse models.
28843594	In an acute DISEASE_D064420_toxicity study, significant mortality was observed after administering 10X and 3X SPECIES_10090_mouse-equivalent doses (MED) of OEP-NF, respectively.
28843594	Increases in liver/body weight ratio, GENE_10090)_ALT and GENE_10090)_AST were observed in female B6C3F<sub>1</sub>SPECIES_10090_mice after gavaging 2X and 1.5X MED of OEP-NF.
28843594	Similar findings were observed in a 90-day feeding study.
28843594	These alterations were paralleled by altered expression of gene- and microRNA-signatures of hepatotoxicity, including GENE_10090)_Cd36, GENE_10090)_Nqo1, GENE_10090)_Aldoa, GENE_10090)_Txnrd1, GENE_10090)_Scd1 and GENE_10090)_Ccng1, as well as GENE_10090)_miR_192, GENE_10090)_miR_193a and miR-125b and were most pronounced in female B6C3F<sub>1</sub>SPECIES_10090_mice.
28843594	Body weight loss, observed at week 1, was followed by DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain throughout the feeding studies.
28843594	These findings bolster safety and efficacy concerns for OEP-NF, and argue strongly for implementation of pre-market DISEASE_D064420_toxicity studies within the dietary supplement industry.
28837763	Exposure to Electrophiles Impairs Reactive CHEMICAL__Persulfide-Dependent Redox Signaling in Neuronal Cells.
28837763	Electrophiles such as CHEMICAL_30785_methylmercury (CHEMICAL__MeHg) affect cellular functions by covalent modification with endogenous CHEMICAL_D013438_thiols.
28837763	Reactive CHEMICAL__persulfide species were recently reported to mediate antioxidant responses and redox signaling because of their strong nucleophilicity.
28837763	In this study, we used CHEMICAL__MeHg as an environmental electrophile and found that exposure of cells to the exogenous electrophile elevated intracellular concentrations of the endogenous electrophilic molecule CHEMICAL_C525106_8_nitroguanosine_3_5_cyclic_monophosphate (CHEMICAL_C525106_8_nitro_cGMP), accompanied by depletion of reactive CHEMICAL__persulfide species and CHEMICAL__8_SH_cGMP which is a metabolite of CHEMICAL_C525106_8_nitro_cGMP.
28837763	Exposure to CHEMICAL__MeHg also induced S-guanylation and activation of GENE_3265_H_Ras followed by DISEASE_D009410_injury_to_cerebellar_granule_neurons.
28837763	The electrophile-induced activation of redox signaling and the consequent cell damage were attenuated by pretreatment with a reactive CHEMICAL__persulfide species SPECIES_9606_donor.
28837763	In conclusion, exogenous electrophiles such as CHEMICAL__MeHg with strong electrophilicity impair the redox signaling regulatory mechanism, particularly of intracellular reactive CHEMICAL__persulfide species and therefore lead to cellular pathogenesis.
28837763	Our results suggest that reactive CHEMICAL__persulfide species may be potential therapeutic targets for attenuating cell injury by electrophiles.
28842503	The CHEMICAL__C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain of GENE_10090)_angiopoietin_like_4 stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis and promotes energy expenditure.
28842503	GENE_10090)_Angptl4 (GENE_10090)_Angiopoietin_like_4) is a circulating protein secreted by white and brown adipose tissues and the liver.
28842503	Structurally, GENE_10090)_Angptl4 contains an CHEMICAL__N-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCD) connected to a CHEMICAL__C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (FLD) via a cleavable linker, and both full-length GENE_10090)_Angptl4 and its individual domains circulate in the bloodstream.
28842503	GENE_10090)_Angptl4 inhibits extracellular GENE_10090)_lipoprotein_lipase (GENE_10090)_LPL) activity and stimulates the lipolysis of CHEMICAL_D014280_triacylglycerol stored by adipocytes in the white adipose tissue (WAT).
28842503	The former activity is furnished by the CCD, but the GENE_10090)_Angptl4 domain responsible for stimulating adipocyte lipolysis is unknown.
28842503	We show here that the purified FLD of GENE_10090)_Angptl4 is sufficient to stimulate lipolysis in SPECIES_10090_mouse primary adipocytes and that increasing circulating FLD levels in SPECIES_10090_mice through SPECIES_10535_adenovirus-mediated overexpression (Ad-FLD) not only induces WAT lipolysis in vivo but also reduces diet-induced obesity without affecting GENE_10090)_LPL activity.
28842503	Intriguingly, reduced adiposity in Ad-FLD SPECIES_10090_mice was associated with increased CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen consumption, fat utilization, and the expression of thermogenic genes (GENE_10090)_Ucp1 and GENE_10090)_Ppargc1a) in subcutaneous WAT.
28842503	Moreover, Ad-FLD SPECIES_10090_mice exhibited increased CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance.
28842503	Chronically enhancing WAT lipolysis could produce ectopic steatosis because of an overflow of lipids from the WAT to peripheral tissues; however, this did not occur when Ad-FLD SPECIES_10090_mice were fed a high-fat diet.
28842503	Rather, these SPECIES_10090_mice had reductions in both circulating CHEMICAL_D014280_triacylglycerol levels and the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes in the liver and skeletal muscle.
28842503	We conclude that separating the FLD from the CCD-mediated GENE_10090)_LPL-inhibitory activity of full-length GENE_10090)_Angptl4 reveals lipolytic and thermogenic properties with therapeutic relevance to obesity and diabetes.
28843991	Imbalanced immune responses involving inflammatory molecules and immune-related pathways in the lung of acute and subchronic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28843991	Inorganic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic has been claimed to increase the risk of DISEASE_D008171_pulmonary_diseases through ingestion, as opposed to inhalation, which makes it a unique and intriguing environmental toxicant.
28843991	However, the immunotoxic effects of lung, one of the targets of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure, have not been extensively investigated in vivo.
28843991	In the present study, we first confirmed that 2.5, 5 and 10mg/kg CHEMICAL_29678_NaAsO2 orally for 24h dose-dependently triggered the infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages in BALF.
28843991	Not only the transcription activity, but also the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines CHEMICAL__IL-1b, CHEMICAL__IL-6 and GENE_10090)_TNF_a were consistently raised in the lung and BALF of acute CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice.
28843991	Acute oral administration of CHEMICAL_29678_NaAsO2 also raised pulmonary MPO activity and mRNA levels of chemokine GENE_10090)_Mip_2 and GENE_10090)_Mcp_1.
28843991	Meanwhile, obvious histopathological damages with inflammatory cells infiltration and erythrocyte aggregation around the capillaries were verified in the lung of SPECIES_10090_mice drank CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-rich water freely for 3 months.
28843991	Furthermore, we affirmed notable disturbance of GENE_10090)_CD4(+) T-cell differentiation in the lung of acute CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-exposed SPECIES_10090_mice, as demonstrated by up-regulated mRNA levels of regulator GENE_10090)_Gata3 and cytokine CHEMICAL__Il-4 of GENE_10090)_Th2, enhanced GENE_10090)_Foxp3 and GENE_10090)_Il_10 of Treg, down-regulated T-bet and Ifn-y of GENE_10090)_Th1, as well as lessened Ror-yt and GENE_10090)_Il_23 of Th17.
28843991	However, impressive elevation of cytokine Ifn-y and GENE_10090)_Il_23, as well as moderate enhancement of GENE_10090)_Il_4 and GENE_10090)_Il_10 were found in the lung by subchronic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic administration.
28843991	Finally, our present study demonstrated that both a single and sustained CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic exposure prominently increased the expression of immune-related GENE_10090)_p38, GENE_10090)_JNK, GENE_26417;26413_ERK1_2 and NF-kB proteins in the lung tissue.
28843991	While disrupting the pulmonary redox homeostasis by increasing CHEMICAL_566274_MDA levels, exhausting CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH and impaired enzyme activities of CAT and CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-Px, antioxidant regulator GENE_10090)_NRF2 and its downstream targets GENE_10090)_HO_1 and GENE_14873;68214_GSTO1_2 were also up-regulated by both acute and subchronic CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic treatment.
28843991	Conclusively, our present study demonstrated both acute and subchronic oral administration of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic triggers multiple pulmonary immune responses involving inflammatory molecules and T-cell differentiation, which might be closely associated with the imbalanced redox status and activation of immune-related MAPKs, NF-kB and anti-inflammatory GENE_10090)_NRF2 pathways.
28844481	GENE_7015_Tert-butylhydroquinone attenuates oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in high salt-induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertension.
28844481	Excessive oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are implicated in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D006973_hypertension.
28844481	It is reported that GENE_7015_tert-butylhydroquinone (CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ), a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(GENE_4780_Nrf2)-inducer, has a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effect.
28844481	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ in high salt induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertension and to identify whether the beneficial effects were induced by inhibiting PVN oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28844481	Male SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats were fed with high salt diet (HS, 8% CHEMICAL_D012965_NaCl) or normal salt diet (NS, 0.3% CHEMICAL_D012965_NaCl).
28844481	These SPECIES_10116_rats were administration of CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ (150mg/kg/d) by oral gavage for 16 weeks.
28844481	Our results showed that high salt intake resulted in higher mean arterial pressure, DISEASE_D006332_cardiac_hypertrophy as well as increased plasma level of CHEMICAL_D009638_norepinephrine and GENE_10116)_interleukin_IL_1b, GENE_10116)_IL_6 compared with NS SPECIES_10116_rats.
28844481	It increased PVN level of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species, gp91(phox), GENE_3553_IL_1b, GENE_3569_IL_6, p-IKKb and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activity, decreased PVN level of GENE_4780_Nrf2 and CHEMICAL__Cu/CHEMICAL__Zn-SOD.
28844481	Chronic administration of CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ significantly attenuated these changes in HS SPECIES_10116_rats.
28844481	These data suggest that the protective effects of CHEMICAL_C018855_tBHQ in salt induced DISEASE_D006973_hypertension are partly due to inhibiting oxidative stress and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in PVN.
28844784	CHEMICAL_D004026_Dieldrin-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity involves impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and an endoplasmic reticulum stress response in SPECIES_10116_rat dopaminergic cells.
28844784	Mitochondria are sensitive targets of environmental chemicals.
28844784	CHEMICAL_D004026_Dieldrin (CHEMICAL__DLD) is an CHEMICAL__organochlorine pesticide that remains a SPECIES_9606_human health concern due to high lipid bioaccumulation, and it has been epidemiologically associated to an increased risk for DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD).
28844784	As DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction is involved in the etiology of DISEASE_D010300_PD, this study aimed to determine whether CHEMICAL__DLD impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics in dopaminergic cells.
28844784	SPECIES_10116_Rat immortalized dopaminergic N27 cells were treated for 24 or 48h with one dose of either a solvent control, 2.5, 25, or 250 M CHEMICAL__DLD.
28844784	Dopaminergic cells treated with 250 M CHEMICAL__DLD showed increased GENE_10116)_Casp3/7 activity at 24 and 48h.
28844784	CHEMICAL__DLD also caused a dose dependent reduction in cell viability of    25-30% over 24h.
28844784	No significant effects on cell viability, apoptosis, nor DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity were detected at 24 or 48h with 2.5 M CHEMICAL__DLD.
28844784	Following a 24h exposure to 2.5 and 25 M CHEMICAL__DLD, viable cells were subjected to a mitochondrial stress test using the Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer.
28844784	Following three independent experiments conducted for rigor, dopaminergic cells that were treated with 2.5 and 25 M CHEMICAL__DLD consistently showed a reduction in maximum respiration and spare capacity compared to the control group.
28844784	Molecular responses were measured to determine mechanisms of CHEMICAL__DLD-induced DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction.
28844784	There were no changes in transcripts associated with mitochondrial membrane potential and permeability (e.g.
28844784	Ant, GENE_10116)_Hk1, GENE_10116)_Tspo, Vdac), nor GENE_10116)_PI3_K/GENE_10116)_Akt/GENE_10116)_mTor signaling or mitochondrial-associated apoptotic factors (GENE_10116)_Bax, GENE_10116)_Bcl2, GENE_10116)_Casp3).
28844784	However, transcript levels for GENE_10116)_Chop/GENE_10116)_Gadd153 (GENE_10116)_DNA_Damage_Inducible_Transcript_3), an apoptotic gene activated following endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, were 3-fold higher in N27 cells treated with CHEMICAL__DLD, suggesting that CHEMICAL__DLD-induced DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction is related to ER stress.
28844784	CHEMICAL_D004298_Dopamine cells were also assessed for changes in GENE_10116)_tyrosine_hydroxylase (GENE_10116)_TH) protein, which did not differ among treatments.
28844784	This study demonstrates that CHEMICAL__DLD impairs oxidative respiration in CHEMICAL_D004298_dopamine cells, and ER stress is hypothesized to be associated with the CHEMICAL__DLD-induced DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction.
28844784	This is important as ER stress is also linked to DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28844784	This study presents mechanistic insight into pesticide-induced DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction using a chemical that is reported to be associated to a higher risk for DISEASE_D019636_neurodegenerative_disease.
28844848	Nano-sized CHEMICAL_C009495_titanium_dioxide DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in SPECIES_10116_rat prostate and testis: Possible ameliorative effect of CHEMICAL_C008548_morin.
28844848	This study investigated the effect of short-term oral exposure to nano-sized CHEMICAL_C009495_titanium_dioxide (nCHEMICAL_32234_TiO2) on Wistar SPECIES_10116_rat prostate and testis, and the associating reproductive-related alterations.
28844848	The study also evaluated the potential ameliorative effect of the natural CHEMICAL_47916_flavonoid, CHEMICAL_C008548_morin, on nCHEMICAL_32234_TiO2-induced aberrations.
28844848	Intragastric administration of nCHEMICAL_32234_TiO2 (50mg/kg/day for 1, 2 and 3weeks) increased testicular GENE_10116)_gamma_glutamyltransferase (y-GT) activity and decreased testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (GENE_10116)_StAR) and c-kit gene expression, serum CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone level and sperm count.
28844848	nCHEMICAL_32234_TiO2-treated SPECIES_10116_rats also exhibited prostatic and testicular altered CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione levels, elevated GENE_10116)_TNF_a levels, up-regulated Fas, GENE_10116)_Bax and GENE_10116)_caspase_3 gene expression, down-regulated GENE_10116)_Bcl_2 gene expression and enhanced prostatic lipid peroxidation.
28844848	Sperm DISEASE_D000014_malformation and elevated testicular acid phosphatase (ACP) activity and CHEMICAL_D008315_malondialdehyde level, serum prostatic acid phosphatase activity, prostate specific antigen (PSA), gonadotrophin and CHEMICAL_D004958_estradiol levels occurred after the 2 and 3week regimens.
28844848	CHEMICAL_C008548_Morin (30mg/kg/day administered intragastrically for 5weeks) mitigated nCHEMICAL_32234_TiO2-induced prostatic and DISEASE_D014947_testicular_injury as evidenced by lowering serum PSA level, testicular y-GT and ACP activities and GENE_10116)_TNF_a level, along with hampering both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.
28844848	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C008548_morin alleviated prostatic lipid peroxidation, raised prostatic CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione level, and relieved testicular reductive stress.
28844848	Additionally, CHEMICAL_C008548_morin increased testicular GENE_10116)_StAR and c-kit mRNA expression, raised the sperm count, reduced DISEASE_D009140_sperm_deformities and modified the altered hormone profile.
28844848	Histopathological evaluation supported the biochemical findings.
28844848	In conclusion, CHEMICAL_C008548_morin could ameliorate nCHEMICAL_32234_TiO2-induced prostatic and DISEASE_D014947_testicular_injury and the corresponding reproductive-related aberrations via redox regulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, promoting steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, and improving sperm count and morphology.
28844859	Endoplasmic reticulum stress restrains GENE_10116)_hepatocyte_growth_factor expression in hepatic stellate cells and SPECIES_10116_rat DISEASE_D017114_acute_liver_failure model.
28844859	The aim of this study was to test whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress suppresses GENE_10116)_hepatocyte_growth_factor (GENE_10116)_HGF) expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and whether ER stress plays a role in alleviating CHEMICAL_60313_d_Galactosamine and Lipopolysaccharide (CHEMICAL_60313_D_GalN/LPS)-induced DISEASE_D017114_acute_liver_failure (DISEASE_D017114_ALF) by regulating GENE_10116)_HGF expression.
28844859	SPECIES_10116_Rat HSCs line HSC-T6 were treated with the ER stress inducers CHEMICAL_D014415_tunicamycin or CHEMICAL_D019284_thapsigargin, and ER stress inhibitors CHEMICAL_C075773_sodium_4_phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) or salubrinal, respectively.
28844859	Recombinant lentivirus containing GENE_10116)_eukaryotic_translation_initiation_factor_2a (GENE_10116)_eIf2a), named LV-GENE_10116)_eIf2a-shRNA-GFP was produced to block GENE_10116)_eIf2a activated by ER stress.
28844859	A SPECIES_10116_rat DISEASE_D017114_ALF model was created by intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICAL_60313_D_GalN/LPS, and 100  mg/kg 4-PBA was injected 6  h before injection as an inhibitor of ER stress.
28844859	Levels of GENE_10116)_HGF, GENE_10116)_c_Met, GENE_10116)_vascular_endothelial_growth_factor (GENE_10116)_VEGF), GENE_10116)_GRP78, GENE_10116)_eIf2a, CHEMICAL__phospho-GENE_10116)_eIF2a, GENE_10116)_ATF4 and GENE_10116)_CHOP in  vitro and in  vivo were measured.
28844859	Our results demonstrated that ER stress stimulated GENE_10116)_VEGF but inhibited GENE_10116)_HGF expression in HSC-T6 cells.
28844859	Both the stimulation of GENE_10116)_VEGF and the inhibition of GENE_10116)_HGF could be partly prevented by 4-PBA or Salubrinal.
28844859	GENE_10116)_eIf2a expression was upregulated during ERS and interfering GENE_10116)_eIf2a expression proportionately down-regulated GENE_10116)_HGF expression.
28844859	Inhibition of GENE_10116)_HGF and GENE_10116)_c_Met expression was also observed in the DISEASE_D017114_ALF SPECIES_10116_rat.
28844859	Treatment with 4-PBA prevented the reduction of GENE_10116)_HGF in DISEASE_D017114_ALF SPECIES_10116_rats.
28844859	ER stress regulates GENE_10116)_HGF expression in  vitro and in  vivo, which depends on GENE_10116)_eIf2a pathway.
28844859	Reduction in DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage of DISEASE_D017114_ALF by 4-PBA is associated with attenuation of ER stress and maintaining GENE_10116)_HGF production.
28844962	Inhibitory effects of CHEMICAL_C016392_3_3_diindolylmethane on epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by endocrine disrupting chemicals in cellular and SPECIES_1383439_xenograft SPECIES_10090_mouse models of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer.
28844962	As a phytoestrogen, CHEMICAL_C016392_3_3_diindolylmethane (CHEMICAL_50182_DIM) plays a chemopreventive role by inhibiting DISEASE_D009369_cancer progression.
28844962	In this study, we examined the effects of CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2), two endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), CHEMICAL_D014260_triclosan (CHEMICAL__TCS) and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA), and CHEMICAL_50182_DIM on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic behaviors of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28844962	An in  vitro assay revealed that E2 (10<sup>-9</sup>  M), CHEMICAL__TCS (10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-7</sup>  M), and CHEMICAL__BPA (10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-7</sup>  M) induced MCF-7  cell proliferation compared to a control through the ER pathway.
28844962	In addition, E2, CHEMICAL__TCS, and CHEMICAL__BPA changed the cell morphology from the epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype and increased the migration and invasion capacity of MCF-7  cells via ER; however, co-treatment with CHEMICAL_50182_DIM (20   M) effectively suppressed E2, CHEMICAL__TCS, and CHEMICAL__BPA-induced cell proliferation, EMT, migration, and invasion of MCF-7  cells.
28844962	Western blot assay revealed that CHEMICAL_50182_DIM regulated the protein expression of EMT- and metastasis-related genes toward the inhibition of these processes.
28844962	Moreover, E2, CHEMICAL__TCS, and CHEMICAL__BPA increased the protein expression of GENE_7852_CXCR4, which is a receptor of chemokine GENE_6387_CXCL12 that is positively involved in DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer metastasis via an ER-dependent pathway.
28844962	Conversely, CHEMICAL_50182_DIM and a GENE_7852_CXCR4 antagonist (CHEMICAL_C088327_AMD3100) decreased GENE_7852_CXCR4 protein expression, which led to inhibition of the EMT process, indicating that CHEMICAL_50182_DIM may suppress E2, CHEMICAL__TCS or CHEMICAL__BPA-induced EMT, migration, and invasion of MCF-7 DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells by suppressing GENE_7852_CXCR4 protein expression.
28844962	These in  vitro effects of E2, CHEMICAL__TCS, CHEMICAL__BPA, and CHEMICAL_50182_DIM were also identified in a SPECIES_1383439_xenografted SPECIES_10090_mouse model transplanted with MCF-7 DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells.
28844962	Taken together, CHEMICAL_50182_DIM is a potent chemopreventive compound for preventing metastatic behaviors of DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cells induced by EDCs with DISEASE_D009369_cancer-related DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28846189	The mechanisms for DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer risk of PM2.5 : Induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem cell properties in human DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer cells.
28846189	Fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) is a major component of air pollutions that are closely associated with increased risk of DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer.
28846189	However, the role of PM2.5 in the etiology of DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer is largely unknown.
28846189	In this study, we performed acute (24 hours) and chronic (five passages) exposure models to investigate the carcinogenetic mechanisms of PM2.5 by targeting the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and DISEASE_D009369_cancer stem cells (CSC) properties in human DISEASE_D002289_non_small_cell_lung_cancer cell line A549.
28846189	We found that both acute and chronic PM2.5 exposure enhanced cell migration and invasion, decreased mRNA expression of epithelial markers and increased mRNA expression of mesenchymal markers.
28846189	Chronic PM2.5 exposure further induced notable EMT morphology and CSC properties, indicating the developing process of cell malignant behaviors from acute to chronic PM2.5 exposure.
28846189	CSC properties induced by chronic PM2.5 exposure characterized with increased cell-surface markers (CD44, ABCG2), self-renewal genes (SOX2 and OCT4), side population cells and neoplastic capacity.
28846189	Furthermore, the levels of three stemness-associated microRNAs, Let-7a, miR-16 and miR-34a, were found to be significantly downregulated by chronic PM2.5 exposure, with microarray data analysis from CHEMICAL__TCGA database showing their lower expression in human DISEASE_C538231_lung_adenocarcinoma tissues than that in the adjacent normal lung tissues.
28846189	These data revealed that the induction of EMT and CSC properties were involved in the DISEASE_D008175_lung_cancer risk of PM2.5 , and implicated CSC properties and related microRNAs as possible biomarkers for carcinogenicity prediction of PM2.5 .
28849599	Estrogenic chemicals at body burden levels attenuate energy metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
28849599	The study aimed to examine effects of environmental CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogens at body burden levels on energy metabolism in fat cells.
28849599	Acclimation of T47D-KBluc cells in CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-deprived medium was established for high performance of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter assay.
28849599	With the assay, relative estrogenic potency of four selected CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, i.e.
28849599	CHEMICAL_D004054_diethylstilbestrol, CHEMICAL__b_estradiol, CHEMICAL_C041594_4_nonylphenol and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A, were determined.
28849599	Immunoblot analysis revealed that the ER agonists at both EC80 and EC100 caused rapid and transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in an ER-dependent manner.
28849599	3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with the ER agonists at EC80 for 24  hours exhibited significant downregulation in mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic function.
28849599	Importantly, EC80 values of CHEMICAL_C041594_4_nonylphenol (6.0  *  10(-10)   m) and CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (1.0  *  10(-8)   m) are in the range of SPECIES_9606_human body burdens.
28849599	The finding that estrogenic chemicals at body burden levels cause significant impact on fat cell energy metabolism raises an important public health issue that deserves more attention.
28850943	CHEMICAL_C082359_Imidacloprid insecticide exposure induces stress and disrupts CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis in male SPECIES_10116_rats.
28850943	In the present study, we evaluated the stress response in adult SPECIES_10116_rats who were administered CHEMICAL_C082359_imidacloprid (CHEMICAL__IMI) orally in two doses (0.5 and 1.0mg/kg bw for 60days).
28850943	It led to an alteration in the levels of CHEMICAL_D003348_cortisone and CHEMICAL_D002395_catecholamines and induced DISEASE_D001523_behavioral_deficits, particularly in the animals exposed to the dose of 1.0mg/kg.
28850943	CHEMICAL__IMI was further analyzed for the effect on CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis in developing and adult SPECIES_10116_rats at a dose of 1.0mg/kg bw where it elicited a DISEASE_D006944_hyperglycemic effect.
28850943	Moreover, we observed an alteration in the mRNA levels of CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporters.
28850943	Histopathological and immunohistochemical data displayed structural perturbations in pancreatic tissue with a decline in the expression of insulin and GENE_10116)_GLUT4, particularly in the developing SPECIES_10116_rats.
28850943	Collectively, CHEMICAL__IMI treatment resulted in stress represented by behavioral and biochemical changes, particularly at a dose of 1.0mg/kg bw.
28850943	Moreover, CHEMICAL__IMI perturbed the CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose regulation through DISEASE_D006944_hyperglycemic activity in both developing and adult SPECIES_10116_rats, an observation clearly evident in the developing SPECIES_10116_rats.
28853863	Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Methylation Patterns Induced by CHEMICAL_D014635_Valproic_Acid in SPECIES_9606_Human Hepatocytes.
28853863	CHEMICAL_D014635_Valproic_acid (CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA) is one of the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drugs in the world.
28853863	Despite its pharmacological importance, it may cause DISEASE_D056486_liver_toxicity and DISEASE_D005234_steatosis through DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction.
28853863	The aim of this study is to further investigate CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA-induced mechanisms of DISEASE_D005234_steatosis by analyzing changes in patterns of methylation in nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
28853863	Therefore, primary SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes (PHHs) were exposed to an incubation concentration of CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA that was shown to cause DISEASE_D005234_steatosis without inducing overt DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity.
28853863	CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA was administered daily for 5 days, and this was followed by a 3 day washout (WO).
28853863	Methylated DNA regions (DMRs) were identified by using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) method.
28853863	The nDNA DMRs after CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA treatment could indeed be classified into oxidative stress- and DISEASE_D005234_steatosis-related pathways.
28853863	In particular, networks of the DISEASE_D005234_steatosis-related gene GENE_2033_EP300 provided novel insight into the mechanisms of DISEASE_D064420_toxicity induced by CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA treatment.
28853863	Furthermore, we suggest that CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA induces a crosstalk between nDNA hypermethylation and mtDNA hypomethylation that plays a role in oxidative stress and DISEASE_D005234_steatosis development.
28853863	Although most CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA-induced methylation patterns appeared reversible upon terminating CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA treatment, 31 nDNA DMRs (including 5 CHEMICAL_D015032_zinc finger protein genes) remained persistent after the WO period.
28853863	Overall, we have shown that MeDIP-seq analysis is highly informative in disclosing novel mechanisms of CHEMICAL_D014635_VPA-induced DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in PHHs.
28853863	Our results thus provide a prototype for the novel generation of interesting methylation biomarkers for repeated dose DISEASE_D056486_liver_toxicity in vitro.
28864214	MicroRNA-218 acts by repressing TNFR1-mediated activation of NF-kB, which is involved in MUC5AC DISEASE_D007249_hyper_production_and_inflammation in smoking-induced DISEASE_D001988_bronchiolitis of DISEASE_D029424_COPD.
28864214	Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DISEASE_D029424_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease (DISEASE_D029424_COPD), which is largely attributable to cigarette smoke (CS).
28864214	However, little is known about the effect of miRNAs on CS-induced mucus hypersecretion and the inflammatory response in the airway epithelium, which are pathological characteristics of DISEASE_D029424_COPD-related chronic DISEASE_D001988_bronchiolitis.
28864214	As determined in the present investigation, population-based data indicate that smokers with DISEASE_D029424_COPD had serious DISEASE_D029424_airflow_obstruction_and_inflammation, whereas smokers without DISEASE_D029424_COPD had mild DISEASE_D029424_airflow_obstruction_and_inflammation.
28864214	Moreover, levels of serum miR-218 positively correlated with FEV1/FVC% and negatively correlated with levels of serum IL-6 and IL-8.
28864214	In human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) decreased miR-218 levels and increased levels of MUC5AC, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), DISEASE_D009369_tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and p-p65.
28864214	Enhancement of miR-218 levels by an miR-218 mimic blocked these CSE-induced changes.
28864214	Moreover, luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-218 bound to the 3'UTR region of TNFR1 mRNA.
28864214	Down-regulation of TNFR1 blocked the CSE-induced increases of MUC5AC, IL-6, and IL-8 and the activation of NF-kB.
28864214	Furthermore, over-expression of miR-218 attenuated the CSE-induced overproduction of MUC5AC, IL-6, and IL-8, effects that were reversed by elevated expression of TNFR1.
28864214	In sum, our findings provide a mechanism by which miR-218 regulates CSE-induced MUC5AC DISEASE_D007249_hyper_production_and_inflammation by targeting TNFR1-mediated activation of NF-kB, indicating that overexpression of miR-218 may be a strategy against cigarette smoking-induced DISEASE_D001988_bronchiolitis in DISEASE_D029424_COPD.
28859904	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A decreases CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone synthesis by disrupting CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol homeostasis in SPECIES_10116_rat granulosa cells.
28859904	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is an endocrine disruptor used in a variety of consumer products.
28859904	Exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA leads to alterations in steroidogenesis of ovarian granulosa cells.
28859904	Here, we analyzed the mechanism by which CHEMICAL__BPA alters CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone biosynthesis in immature SPECIES_10116_rat granulosa cells.
28859904	CHEMICAL__BPA increased expression of GENE_10116)_steroidogenic_acute_regulatory_protein (GENE_10116)_StAR), CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and CHEMICAL__3b_hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in granulosa cells; however, CHEMICAL__BPA prevented the basal and the FSH-induced CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone production.
28859904	CHEMICAL__BPA caused sequestration of CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol to the perinuclear area, as evident by the Filipin staining.
28859904	CHEMICAL__BPA decreased mRNA expression of CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP binding cassette transporter-A1 (GENE_10116)_Abca1) and increased level of CHEMICAL_15889_sterol regulatory element binding protein 1.
28859904	Addition of exogenous cell-permeable CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol restored the effect of CHEMICAL__BPA on GENE_10116)_Abca1 and GENE_10116)_Star mRNA expression and partially reversed CHEMICAL__BPA's effect on CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone production.
28859904	These results indicate that exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA disrupts CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol homeostasis leading to decreased CHEMICAL_D011374_progesterone production in immature SPECIES_10116_rat granulosa cells.
28865727	Altered mitochondrial epigenetics associated with subchronic CHEMICAL_D004317_doxorubicin DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity.
28865727	CHEMICAL_D004317_Doxorubicin (CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX), a potent and broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent, causes an irreversible, cumulative and dose-dependent DISEASE_D009202_cardiomyopathy that ultimately leads to DISEASE_D006333_congestive_heart_failure.
28865727	The mechanisms responsible for CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity remain poorly understood, but seem to involve DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction on several levels.
28865727	Epigenetics may explain a portion of this effect.
28865727	Since DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction may affect the epigenetic landscape, we hypothesize that this DISEASE_D066126_cardiac_toxicity may result from epigenetic changes related to disruption of mitochondrial function.
28865727	To test this hypothesis, eight-week-old SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats (n=6/group) were administered 7 weekly injections with CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX (2mgkg-1) or saline, and sacrificed two weeks after the last injection.
28865727	We assessed gene expression patterns by qPCR, global DNA methylation by ELISA, and proteome CHEMICAL_25094_lysine acetylation status by Western blot in cardiac tissue from saline and CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX-treated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28865727	We show for the first time that CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX treatment decreases global DNA methylation in heart but not in liver.
28865727	These differences were accompanied by alterations in mRNA expression of multiple functional gene groups.
28865727	CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX disrupted cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis, as demonstrated by decreased mtDNA levels and altered transcript levels for multiple mitochondrial genes encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.
28865727	Transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism and epigenetic modulation were also affected.
28865727	Western blotting analyses indicated a differential protein acetylation pattern in cardiac mitochondrial fractions of CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX-treated SPECIES_10116_rats compared to controls.
28865727	Additionally, CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX treatment increased the activity of histone deacetylases.
28865727	These results suggest an interplay between DISEASE_D028361_mitochondrial_dysfunction and epigenetic alterations, which may be a primary determinant of CHEMICAL_D004317_DOX-induced DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity.
28864276	Physiopathology of multiple organ dysfunctions in severely monocrotophos-poisoned rabbits.
28864276	OBJECTIVE: Acute CHEMICAL_D010755_organophosphorus pesticides poisoning has a serious threat on people's health.
28864276	This study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in severely monocrotophos-poisoned rabbits.
28864276	METHODS: Chinchilla rabbits were used to build the CHEMICAL_D008999_monocrotophos-poisoned animal model via subcutaneous abdominal injection.
28864276	Acetylcholinesterase activity was determined using the CHEMICAL__dithiobisnitrobenzoic_acid enzyme kinetics method, and the free CHEMICAL_D010755_organophosphorus (FOP) toxic substances content was analyzed using the enzyme inhibition method.
28864276	The contents of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), interleukin 1-b (IL-b) and CHEMICAL_D013929_thromboxane_B2 (CHEMICAL_28728_TXB2) in the plasma and tissue homogenates were determined via radioimmunoassay.
28864276	RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after exposure, in comparison to the plasma, blood cells and homogenates of various tissues, the bile had a significantly different FOP content (P  <  0.05).
28864276	In different phases, HE staining results confirmed that several degrees of pathological lesions (such as hemorrhage, edema, degeneration and necrosis) were detected in FOP poisoned rabbits.
28864276	The CHEMICAL_28728_TXB2 and TNF contents in plasma were significantly higher than those of the control (P  <  0.05).
28864276	Except for the intercostal muscle, all of the tissues had significantly higher CHEMICAL_28728_TXB2 contents than the control.
28864276	The TNF contents of the liver and lung and the IL-1b contents of the liver and kidney were significantly higher than those of the control (P  <  0.05).
28864276	CONCLUSION: FOP stored in the gallbladder may play important role in enterohepatic circulation.
28864276	In MODS rabbits, caused by OP poisoning, the CHEMICAL_28728_TXB2 and TNF-a may play important role in inflammatory response and complement and coagulation systems respectively.
28871336	CHEMICAL_C088658_Zoledronate dysregulates CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid metabolism in renal tubular epithelial cells to induce nephrotoxicity.
28871336	CHEMICAL_C088658_Zoledronate is a CHEMICAL_D004164_bisphosphonate that is widely used in the treatment of DISEASE_D001851_metabolic_bone_diseases.
28871336	However, CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate induces significant nephrotoxicity associated with DISEASE_D007683_acute_tubular_necrosis and DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis when administered intravenously.
28871336	There is speculation that CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate-induced nephrotoxicity may result from its pharmacological activity as an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.
28871336	In this report, SPECIES_9606_human proximal tubular SPECIES_9606_HK_2 cells and SPECIES_10090_mouse models were combined to dissect the molecular pathways underlying DISEASE_D007674_nephropathy caused by CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate treatments.
28871336	Metabolomic and proteomic assays revealed that multiple cellular processes were significantly disrupted, including the GENE_7040_TGFb pathway, CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid metabolism and small GTPase signaling in CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate-treated SPECIES_9606_HK_2 cells (50   M) as compared with those in controls.
28871336	CHEMICAL_C088658_Zoledronate treatments in cells (50   M) and SPECIES_10090_mice (3  mg/kg) increased GENE_10090)_TGFb/GENE_10090)_Smad3 pathway activation to induce DISEASE_D005355_fibrosis and DISEASE_D007674_kidney_injury, and specifically elevated lipid accumulation and expression of fibrotic proteins.
28871336	Conversely, CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid transport protein  GENE_10090)_Slc27a2  deficiency or co-administration of GENE_10090)_PPARA agonist CHEMICAL_D011345_fenofibrate (20  mg/kg) prevented CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate-induced lipid accumulation and DISEASE_D007674_kidney_fibrosis in SPECIES_10090_mice, indicating that over-expression of CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid transporter GENE_10090)_SLC27A2 and defective CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid b-oxidation following CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate treatments were significant factors contributing to its nephrotoxicity.
28871336	These pharmacological and genetic studies provide an important mechanistic insight into CHEMICAL_C088658_zoledronate-associated kidney DISEASE_D064420_toxicity that will aid in development of therapeutic prevention and treatment options for this DISEASE_D007674_nephropathy.
28871463	Specific effects of prenatal CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP exposure on neuroendocrine gene expression in the developing hypothalamus of male SPECIES_10116_rats.
28871463	Endocrine disrupting chemicals may disrupt developing neuroendocrine systems, especially when the exposure occurs during a critical period.
28871463	This study aimed to investigate whether prenatal exposure to CHEMICAL_D004051_di_2_ethylhexyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP), a major component of plasticizers used worldwide, disrupted the development of a network of genes important for neuroendocrine function in male SPECIES_10116_rats.
28871463	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_rats were treated with SPECIES_381124_corn oil (vehicle control), 2, 10 or 50  mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP by gavage from gestational day 14 to 19.
28871463	The neuroendocrine gene expressions were quantified using a 48-gene Taqman qPCR array in the whole hypothalamus of neonatal SPECIES_10116_rats (postnatal day 1) and in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), DISEASE_D002527_medial_preoptic_nucleus (DISEASE_D002527_MPN) and DISEASE_D012607_arcuate_nucleus (DISEASE_D012607_ARC) of adult SPECIES_10116_rats (postnatal day 70).
28871463	Immunofluorescent signals of ERa and GENE_10116)_CYP19 were detected using the confocal microscopy in adult AVPV, DISEASE_D002527_MPN and DISEASE_D012607_ARC.
28871463	The results showed that prenatal CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP exposure perturbed somatic and reproductive development of offspring.
28871463	Eleven genes were down-regulated in neonatal hypothalamus and showed non-monotonic dose-response relationships, that the 10  mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP dosage was associated with the greatest number of gene expression changes.
28871463	Different from this, 14 genes were altered in adult AVPV, DISEASE_D002527_MPN and DISEASE_D012607_ARC and most of alterations were found in the 50  mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP group.
28871463	Also, 50  mg/kg CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP reduced ERa expression in the DISEASE_D012607_ARC, but no alterations were observed in GENE_10116)_CYP19 expression.
28871463	These results indicated that prenatal CHEMICAL_D004051_DEHP exposure may perturb DISEASE_D007027_hypothalamic gene programming and the influences are permanent.
28871463	The effects showed dependence on developmental stages and nuclei region.
28865757	A cell impedance-based real-time in vitro assay to assess the DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of CHEMICAL_D000666_amphotericin_B formulations.
28865757	Aerosolized liposomal CHEMICAL_D000666_amphotericin_B (L-AmB) has been investigated as prophylaxis against DISEASE_D009362_invasive_aspergillosis.
28865757	However, the clinical results are controversial and some trials suggest that DISEASE_D064420_toxicity could be a limitation for wider use.
28865757	Our aim was to assess the dynamics of cell DISEASE_D064420_toxicity induced in a SPECIES_9606_human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) after exposure to L-AmB (50 to 400 g/ml) or CHEMICAL_D000666_amphotericin_B deoxycholate (CHEMICAL__D_AmB; 50 to 200 g/ml) by monitoring real-time A549 cell viability using an impedance-based technology.
28865757	Results were expressed as cell index values integrating cell adhesion, proliferation, and survival.
28865757	In parallel, the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was quantified at 6 and 24h after drug addition by real-time RT-PCR on cell lysates.
28865757	No sustained reduction of cell indexes was observed with L-AmB or empty liposomes, even at 400 g/ml.
28865757	Only the highest concentration tested of L-AmB (400 g/ml) yielded transient significant 6-fold and 4-fold induction of GENE_7124_TNF_a and GENE_3576_IL_8 mRNAs, respectively.
28865757	In contrast, CHEMICAL__D_AmB induced a decrease in cell indexes and only the 50 g/ml concentration of CHEMICAL__D_AmB was followed by cell recovery, higher concentrations leading to cell death.
28865757	Significant 4-fold, 7-fold and 3-fold inductions of GENE_7124_TNF_a, GENE_3576_IL_8 and GENE_90865_IL_33 mRNAs were also observed at 6h with 50 g/ml of CHEMICAL__D_AmB.
28865757	In conclusion, continuous cell impedance measurement showed no DISEASE_D064420_toxicity on overall cellular behavior although a slight proinflammatory cytokine expression is possible after L-AmB challenge.
28865757	Real-time kinetics of cell impedance is an interesting tool for initial screening of cell DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28865950	Individual and combined toxicological effects of CHEMICAL_C007262_deoxynivalenol and CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone on SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes in in vitro chronic exposure conditions.
28865950	While numerous surveys highlighted the natural co-occurrence of mycotoxins in food, data about their toxicological combined effects is still limited.
28865950	This is especially the case for chronic exposure conditions, although the latter are more representative of the mycotoxin risk associated with food consumption than acute exposure.
28865950	In the present study, cell viability and gene expression levels of relevant hepatocyte-specific functions were evaluated for the HepaRG SPECIES_9606_human liver cell line exposed to CHEMICAL_C007262_deoxynivalenol (CHEMICAL__DON) and/or CHEMICAL_D015025_zearalenone (CHEMICAL__ZEA) during 14, 28 and 42days at three subtoxic concentrations corresponding to i) the determined average exposure dose of French adult population, ii) the tolerable daily intake established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee and iii) the maximum level permitted by the European regulation in cereals intended for direct SPECIES_9606_human consumption.
28865950	For the latter, CHEMICAL__DON and CHEMICAL__DON+CHEMICAL__ZEA induced 90% cell mortality after 14 days.
28865950	In addition, depending on the considered toxin or mixture, doses and exposure periods, important variations of gene expression levels were observed.
28865950	Despite the fact that in vitro conditions differ from the in vivo situation, the obtained results clearly highlighted that long-term toxicological effects of chronic exposure to mycotoxin combinations should be further investigated and, if necessary, taken into consideration at the regulatory level.
28866332	CHEMICAL_D026023_Permethrin decreased insulin-stimulated GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation dependent on GENE_5594_extracellular_signal_regulated_kinase_1 (GENE_5594_ERK), but not CHEMICAL_D000667_AMP-activated protein kinase a (AMPKa), in C2C12 myotubes.
28866332	Previously 10   M CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin (38.7% cis and 59.4% trans isomers), a CHEMICAL__pyrethroid insecticide widely used in agriculture and household products for pest control, was reported to reduce insulin-stimulated CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (p-GENE_207_AKT) in C2C12 SPECIES_10090_mouse myotubes.
28866332	The underlying mechanisms on how CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin decreases insulin-stimulated GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation, however, are unknown.
28866332	Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the possible mechanism(s) through which CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin reduced insulin-stimulated GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes.
28866332	CHEMICAL_D026023_Permethrin treatment, at 10   M, decreased insulin-stimulated membrane CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporter type 4 (GENE_6517_GLUT4) and GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation, and DISEASE_C562709_increased_insulin_receptor_substrate_1 (GENE_3667_IRS1) Ser307 phosphorylation in the presence of insulin.
28866332	The inactivation of GENE_207_AKT by CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin was independent of AMPKa.
28866332	GENE_5594_ERK inactivation by CHEMICAL_C113580_U0126, however, restored insulin-stimulated GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation, which was decreased by CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin treatment.
28866332	These results suggest that CHEMICAL_D026023_permethrin decreased insulin-stimulated GENE_207_AKT phosphorylation via GENE_5594_ERK activation, but not by AMPKa inactivation.
28866748	Early response of CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione- and GENE_10116)_thioredoxin-dependent antioxidant defense systems to CHEMICAL__Tl(I)- and CHEMICAL__Tl_III_-mediated oxidative stress in adherent DISEASE_D010673_pheochromocytoma (PC12adh) cells.
28866748	CHEMICAL_D013793_Thallium (CHEMICAL__Tl) is a toxic heavy metal that causes oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo.
28866748	In this work, we evaluated the production of CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen (ROS)- and CHEMICAL_D009584_nitrogen (RNS)-reactive species in adherent PC12 (PC12adh) cells exposed for 0.5-6  h to CHEMICAL__Tl_I_ or CHEMICAL__Tl(III) (10-100    M).
28866748	In this system, CHEMICAL__Tl(I) induced mostly CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 generation while CHEMICAL__Tl_III_ induced CHEMICAL_D006861_H2O2 and CHEMICAL_33258_ONOO_ generation.
28866748	Both cations enhanced iNOS expression and activity, and decreased GENE_10116)_CuZnSOD expression but without affecting its activity.
28866748	CHEMICAL__Tl(I) increased GENE_10116)_MnSOD expression and activity but CHEMICAL__Tl(III) decreased them.
28866748	CHEMICAL_D009249_NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity remained unaffected throughout the period assessed.
28866748	Oxidant levels returned to baseline values after 6  h of incubation, suggesting a response of the antioxidant defense system to the oxidative insult imposed by the cations.
28866748	CHEMICAL__Tl also affected the CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-dependent system: while CHEMICAL__Tl_III_ increased CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression and activity, CHEMICAL__Tl_I_ and CHEMICAL__Tl_III_ decreased GENE_10116)_glutathione_reductase (GENE_10116)_GR) expression.
28866748	However, GENE_10116)_GR activity was mildly enhanced by CHEMICAL__Tl(III).
28866748	Finally, GENE_10116)_thioredoxin-dependent system was evaluated.
28866748	Only CHEMICAL__Tl_I_ increased 2-CHEMICAL_17561_Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys GENE_10116)_Prx) expression, although both cations increased their activity.
28866748	CHEMICAL__Tl(I) increased cytosolic GENE_10116)_thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and decreased mitochondrial (GENE_10116)_TrxR2) expression.
28866748	CHEMICAL__Tl_III_ had a biphasic effect on TrxR1 expression and slightly increased GENE_10116)_TrxR2 expression.
28866748	Despite of this, both cations increased total TrxR activity.
28866748	Obtained results suggest that in CHEMICAL__Tl_I_-exposed PC12adh cells, there is an early response to oxidative stress mainly by CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH-dependent system while in CHEMICAL__Tl(III)-treated cells both CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH- and GENE_10116)_Trx-dependent systems are involved.
28869590	Identification of new susceptibility loci for DISEASE_D003924_type_2_diabetes and shared etiological pathways with DISEASE_D003327_coronary_heart_disease.
28869590	To evaluate the shared genetic etiology of DISEASE_D003924_type_2_diabetes (DISEASE_D003924_T2D) and DISEASE_D003327_coronary_heart_disease (DISEASE_D003327_CHD), we conducted a genome-wide, multi-ancestry study of genetic variation for both diseases in up to 265,678 subjects for DISEASE_D003924_T2D and 260,365 subjects for DISEASE_D003327_CHD.
28869590	We identify 16 previously unreported loci for DISEASE_D003924_T2D and 1 locus for DISEASE_D003327_CHD, including a new DISEASE_D003924_T2D association at a missense variant in GENE_3127_HLA_DRB5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.29).
28869590	We show that genetically mediated increase in DISEASE_D003924_T2D risk also confers higher DISEASE_D003327_CHD risk.
28869590	Joint DISEASE_D003924_T2D-DISEASE_D003327_CHD analysis identified eight variants-two of which are coding-where DISEASE_D003924_T2D and DISEASE_D003327_CHD associations appear to colocalize, including a new joint DISEASE_D003924_T2D-DISEASE_D003327_CHD association at the GENE_80212_CCDC92 locus that also replicated for DISEASE_D003924_T2D.
28869590	The variants associated with both outcomes implicate new pathways as well as targets of existing drugs, including icosapent CHEMICAL_37807_ethyl and adipocyte CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid-binding protein.
28882574	Kupffer cells activation promoted binge drinking-induced DISEASE_D005234_fatty_liver by activating lipolysis in white adipose tissues.
28882574	Kupffer cells (KCs) have been suggested to play critical roles in chronic CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol induced early DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury, but the role of KCs in binge drinking-induced DISEASE_D005234_hepatic_steatosis remains unclear.
28882574	This study was designed to investigate the roles of KCs inhibitor (CHEMICAL_37288_GdCl3) and GENE_7124_TNF_a antagonist (etanercept) on binge drinking-induced DISEASE_D005234_liver_steatosis and to explore the underlying mechanisms.
28882574	SPECIES_10090_C57BL_6 SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to three doses of CHEMICAL_D000431_ethanol (6g/kg body weight) to mimic binge drinking-induced DISEASE_D005234_fatty_liver.
28882574	The results showed that both CHEMICAL_37288_GdCl3 and etanercept partially but significantly alleviated binge drinking-induced increase of hepatic CHEMICAL_17855_triglyceride (TG) level, and reduced fat droplets accumulation in SPECIES_10090_mice liver.
28882574	CHEMICAL_37288_GdCl3 but not etanercept significantly blocked binge drinking-induced activation of KCs.
28882574	However, neither CHEMICAL_37288_GdCl3 nor etanercept could affect binge drinking-induced decrease of GENE_5465_PPAR_a, GENE_51_ACOX, FAS, DISEASE_C563110_ACC and DISEASE_C536778_SCD protein levels, or increase of the LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and GENE_23636_p62 protein level.
28882574	Interestingly, both CHEMICAL_37288_GdCl3 and etanercept significantly suppressed binge drinking-induced phosphorylation of GENE_3991_HSL in epididymal adipose tissues.
28882574	Results of in vitro studies with cultured epididymal adipose tissues showed that GENE_7124_TNF_a could increase the phosphorylation of GENE_3991_HSL in adipose tissues and upgrade the secretion of free CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid (FFA) in the culture medium.
28882574	Taken together, KCs inhibitor and GENE_7124_TNF_a antagonist could partially attenuate binge drinking-induced DISEASE_D005234_liver_steatosis, which might be attributed to the suppression of mobilization of white adipose tissues.
28882574	These results suggest that KCs activation may promote binge drinking-induced DISEASE_D005234_fatty_liver by GENE_7124_TNF_a mediated activation of lipolysis in white adipose tissues.
28882639	Effects of residual levels of CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline on the barrier functions of SPECIES_9606_human intestinal epithelial cells.
28882639	CHEMICAL_D013754_Tetracyclines are frequently used in food-producing animals to treat, control, and prevent DISEASE_D004194_microbial_diseases.
28882639	Concerns are raised regarding the effects of residual levels of CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline, which may be present in the food supply, for emergence of drug-resistance and transfer of antibiotic-resistance gene in intestinal microbiota.
28882639	In contrast, no information is available regarding the possible effects of residual CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline on the gastrointestinal epithelial layer barrier-disruption.
28882639	This study investigates the outcome of CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline treatment on intestinal epithelial cells integrity.
28882639	Intestinal epithelial cells (T84) were treated at concentrations of 0.015, 0.15, 1.5, 15 and 150   g/ml for 48  h in an in  vitro cell culture model.
28882639	The permeability study revealed that 15 and 150   g/ml of CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline causes barrier disruption.
28882639	Whereas the altered mRNA expression of GENE_4854_notch_3, GENE_4855_notch_4, GENE_9075_claudin_2, GENE_9073_claudin_8, GENE_9071_claudin_10, GENE_24146_claudin_15, gap junction alpha 8 and delta 2 and integrin, alpha 3 and alpha L, which are cell-integrity-related genes starts at 1.5   g/ml CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline after 48  h treatment.
28882639	Translocation of GFP-labeled SPECIES_562_bacteria from apical to basal comportment provides proof of concept to intestinal barrier disruption.
28882639	This study is the first to evaluate whether residual concentrations of CHEMICAL_D013752_tetracycline impact epithelial cell integrity.
28882572	Identification of essential transcription factors for adequate DNA damage response after CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene and CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1 exposure by combining transcriptomics with functional genomics.
28882572	DNA damage mediates widespread changes in transcription through activation or repression of transcription factors (TFs).
28882572	However, the consequences of regulating specific TFs for the outcome of the DNA repair process remain incompletely understood.
28882572	Here, we combined transcriptomics and TF binding prediction with functional genomics to identify TFs essential for adequate DNA repair in HepG2 liver cells after a non-cytotoxic dose of carcinogens CHEMICAL_D001564_benzo_a_pyrene (GENE_11331_BaP) (2 M) and CHEMICAL_D016604_aflatoxin_B1 (CHEMICAL__AFB1) (5 M).
28882572	GENE_11331_BaP and CHEMICAL__AFB1 induced a largely common transcriptional response, mediated by similar TFs.
28882572	A SPECIES_11646_lentiviral shRNA screen knocking down the top31 identified TFs, was performed to determine their effect on DNA repair by assessing phosphorylation of GENE_3014_H2AX (GENE_3014_y_H2AX).
28882572	In addition to the top candidate GENE_7157_p53, we identified several other interesting TFs that modulated GENE_3014_y_H2AX after GENE_11331_BaP and CHEMICAL__AFB1 treatment.
28882572	Validation studies confirmed the role of GENE_7157_p53 in reducing GENE_3014_y_H2AX formation and DNA breaks measured by COMET assay after GENE_11331_BaP and CHEMICAL__AFB1 exposure.
28882572	Expression of the cell cycle inhibitor GENE_644914_p21 was profoundly impaired upon GENE_7157_p53 knock-down.
28882572	In addition, the expression of 2 genes involved in CHEMICAL_D009711_nucleotide exchange repair, GENE_1643_DDB2 and GENE_7508_XPC was significantly reduced in GENE_7157_p53 knock-down cells.
28882572	Although GENE_8626_p63 knock-down affected DNA damage upon GENE_11331_BaP treatment this was not associated with altered expression of GENE_1643_DDB2 or GENE_7508_XPC.
28882572	Finally, knock-down of GENE_405_ARNT reduced GENE_3014_y_H2AX in response to GENE_11331_BaP, which was associated with reduced GENE_1543_CYP1A1 expression.
28882572	Importantly, our results suggest a new role for GENE_405_ARNT and its dimerization partner GENE_196_AHR in the occurrence of GENE_3014_H2AX phosphorylation after CHEMICAL__AFB1 treatment.
28882572	These data show that modulation of TF activity impacts on the repair of GENE_11331_BaP- and CHEMICAL__AFB1-induced DNA damage.
28882572	Our study also demonstrates the potential of combining functional genomics with genome-wide expression analysis to identify yet unknown causal relationships, thereby aiding in the interpretation of complex biological systems.
28882636	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen induce proliferation of SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D013964_thyroid_tumor cells via an GENE_2099_estrogen_receptor-dependent pathway.
28882636	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between DISEASE_C536915_papillary_thyroid_carcinoma and environmental exposure to CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) or CHEMICAL__17_b_estrogen (E2) by assessing the effects of these compounds on GENE_2099_estrogen_receptor expression and GENE_207_AKT/GENE_2475_mTOR signaling.
28882636	METHODS: The effects of low levels of CHEMICAL__BPA (1mM-10nM) and CHEMICAL__17b_estradiol (E2, 0.1mM-1nM) on ER expression and cellular proliferation were determined in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_C536915_thyroid_papillary cancer BHP10-3  cells.
28882636	Protein and mRNA levels of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen nuclear receptors (GENE_2099_ERa/GENE_2100_ERb) and membrane receptors (GENE_2852_GPR30) were determined by immunofluorescence assay, Western blotting, and RT-PCR, respectively, and proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay.
28882636	RESULTS: The proliferative effects of CHEMICAL__BPA and E2 were both concentration- and time-dependent.
28882636	Expression of GENE_2099_ERa/GENE_2100_ERb and GENE_2852_GPR30 were enhanced by CHEMICAL__BPA and E2.
28882636	CHEMICAL__BPA and E2 could quickly phosphorylate GENE_207_AKT/GENE_2475_mTOR.
28882636	Moreover, ICI suppressed GENE_2099_ERa expression and activated GENE_2852_GPR30 as did G-1.
28882636	G-15 reversed the effects of E2 on GENE_2852_GPR30 and GENE_207_AKT/GENE_2475_mTOR, but did not alter the effect of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28882636	CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICAL__BPA influences DISEASE_D013964_thyroid_cancer proliferation by regulating expression of ERs and GENE_2852_GPR30, a mechanism that differs from E2.
28882636	In addition, ICI and G-15 may have the potential to be used as anti-DISEASE_D013964_thyroid_cancer agents.
28886987	Consequences of the natural CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid/GENE_6256_retinoid_X_receptor ligands action in SPECIES_9606_human DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line: Focus on functional proteomics.
28886987	The main intention of this study was the investigation of impact of natural biologically active ligands of nuclear CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid/CHEMICAL_26537_retinoid X receptors (all-trans and 9-cis CHEMICAL_D014212_retinoic_acid) on proteomic pattern in SPECIES_9606_human CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptor negative DISEASE_D001943_breast_cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.
28886987	For this purpose, proteomic strategies based on bottom-up method were applied.
28886987	The total cell proteins were extracted utilizing a commercially Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer and separated on 2D CHEMICAL__sodium_dodecyl_sulfate_polyacrylamide_gel electrophoresis (2D CHEMICAL_8984_SDS-PAGE).
28886987	The proteins were subsequently digested in-gel by trypsin and their characterization was achieved by MALDI-DISEASE_D013771_TOF/DISEASE_D013771_TOF.
28886987	By employing PDQuest    software, we identified more than 50 proteins affected by CHEMICAL_D014212_retinoic_acid isomers.
28886987	For more information, 9 proteins which are associated with DISEASE_D009369_tumor process were selected.
28886987	We determined that derivatives of CHEMICAL_D014212_retinoic_acid led to significantly reduced level of proteins belonging to metabolic pathway (e.g.
28886987	GENE_2597_glyceraldehyde_3_phosphate_dehydrogenase or CHEMICAL_D019289_pyruvate kinase 2) or to other cellular processes as apoptosis, regulation of transcription process or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (e.g.
28886987	annexins, CHEMICAL_16862_nucleoside_diphosphate kinase B, GENE_7431_vimentin).
28886987	On the other hand CHEMICAL_D014212_all_trans_retinoic_acid treatment indicates up-regulated effect for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1.
28886988	Perinatal CHEMICAL_4031_ciclosporin_A exposure elicits sex-related DISEASE_D006331_cardiac_dysfunction and DISEASE_D007249_inflammation in the SPECIES_10116_rat progeny.
28886988	Ciclosporin A (CSA) has been identified with harmful DISEASE_D066126_cardiotoxicity but little, if any, is known about the influence of perinatal exposure upon the cardiac function of the progeny.
28886988	The present work examines the premise that perinatal contact with CSA undermines the cardiac function of sexually mature SPECIES_10116_rats.
28886988	Administration of CSA (15mg/kg/day sc) to pregnant SPECIES_10116_rats from day 6 of conception till weaning led to a decrease in gradient of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship by a factor of ten for male progeny and a factor of two for female progeny.
28886988	Perinatally CSA-exposed male, but not female, progeny also demonstrated significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, along with significantly increased JT interval and a tendency towards increased QTc interval, indicating delayed left ventricular (LV) repolarization and perhaps arrhythmogenesis.
28886988	Conversely, female, but not male, progeny exposed perinatally to CSA showed a delay in DISEASE_D054537_atrioventricular_AV_conduction, as demonstrated by significantly prolonged P duration and a tendency towards increased PR interval.
28886988	CSA increased serum GENE_7124_tumor_necrosis_factor_a (GENE_7124_TNFa) and decreased serum GENE_9370_adiponectin levels and cardiac GENE_9370_adiponectin receptor expression in male progeny, in contrast to no effects in female progeny.
28886988	Signs of improved oxidative state (decreased CHEMICAL_C075750_8_isoprostane and increased catalase activity) appeared only in CSA-exposed female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28886988	Moreover, cardiac DISEASE_D009135_muscle_degeneration and pyknosis was more observed in male than in female SPECIES_10116_rats.
28886988	In brief, the sex plays a key role in determining the extent of the deterioration in functional and inflammatory states of the heart that follow perinatal CSA exposure in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28887131	CHEMICAL_D011464_Prostacyclin mimetics afford protection against lipopolysaccharide/CHEMICAL_60313_d_galactosamine-induced DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28887131	Prostacyclin (GENE_10090)_PGI2) serves as a protective, anti-inflammatory mediator and GENE_10090)_PGI2 mimetics may be useful as a hepatoprotective agent.
28887131	We examined whether two GENE_10090)_PGI2 mimetics, CHEMICAL_C105488_ONO_1301 and beraprost, are DISEASE_D056486_beneficial_in_acute_liver_injury and attempted to delineate the possible mechanism underlying the hepatoprotective effect.
28887131	DISEASE_D056486_Acute_liver_injury was induced by lipopolysaccharide/CHEMICAL_60313_d_galactosamine (DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN) in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28887131	SPECIES_10090_Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of GENE_10090)_PGI2 mimetics 1h before DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN challenge.
28887131	Both CHEMICAL_C105488_ONO_1301 and beraprost significantly declined the DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN-induced increase in serum aminotransferase activity.
28887131	CHEMICAL_C105488_ONO_1301 and, to a lesser extent, beraprost inhibited hepatic gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which were sharply elevated by DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN.
28887131	The hepatoprotective effects of CHEMICAL_C105488_ONO_1301, to a lesser extent, of beraprost were also supported by liver histopathological examinations.
28887131	The GENE_10090)_PGI2_receptor antagonist CHEMICAL_C514222_CAY10441 abrogated their hepatoprotective effects.
28887131	The mechanisms behind the benefit of GENE_10090)_PGI2 mimetics in reducing DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN-induced DISEASE_D056486_liver_injury involved, in part, their suppressive effects on increased generation of reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS), since their ability to prevent DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN-induced hepatic apoptosis was mimicked by the antioxidant CHEMICAL_D000111_N_acetyl_l_cysteine.
28887131	They significantly diminished DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN-induced activation of GENE_10090)_signal_transducers_and_activators_of_transcription_3 (GENE_10090)_STAT3) in liver tissues, an effect which was highly associated with their hepatoprotective effects.
28887131	We indicate that IP receptor activation with GENE_10090)_PGI2 mimetics can rescue the damage in the liver induced by DISEASE_C536528_LPS/GENE_10090)_GalN by undermining activation of GENE_10090)_STAT3 and leading to a lower production of ROS.
28887131	Our findings point to GENE_10090)_PGI2 mimetics, especially CHEMICAL_C105488_ONO_1301, as a potential novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of DISEASE_D056486_acute_liver_injury.
28887310	GENE_10090)_Histone_deacetylase_6 inhibition reduces cysts by decreasing CHEMICAL_D000242_cAMP and CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ in knock-out SPECIES_10090_mouse models of polycystic kidney disease.
28887310	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement of multiple renal cysts, often leading to renal failure that cannot be prevented by a current treatment.
28887310	Two proteins encoded by two genes are associated with ADPKD: GENE_5310_PC1 (GENE_5310_pkd1), primarily a signaling molecule, and GENE_5311_PC2 (GENE_5311_pkd2), a CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ channel.
28887310	Dysregulation of CHEMICAL_D000242_cAMP signaling is central to ADPKD, but the molecular mechanism is unresolved.
28887310	Here, we studied the role of GENE_10013_histone_deacetylase_6 (GENE_10013_HDAC6) in regulating cyst growth to test the possibility that inhibiting GENE_10013_HDAC6 might help manage ADPKD.
28887310	Chemical inhibition of GENE_10090)_HDAC6 reduced cyst growth in GENE_10090)_PC1-knock-out SPECIES_10090_mice.
28887310	In proximal tubule-derived, SPECIES_9606_PC1-knock-out cells, GENE_109;112_adenylyl_cyclase_6_and_3_AC6_and_3) are both expressed.
28887310	GENE_112_AC6 protein expression was higher in cells lacking SPECIES_9606_PC1, compared with control cells containing GENE_5310_PC1.
28887310	Intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ was higher in SPECIES_9606_PC1-knock-out cells than in control cells.
28887310	HDAC inhibition caused a drop in intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ and increased CHEMICAL_D000255_ATP-simulated CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ release.
28887310	GENE_10013_HDAC6 inhibition reduced the release of CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ from the endoplasmic reticulum induced by CHEMICAL_D019284_thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_-ATPase.
28887310	GENE_10013_HDAC6 inhibition and treatment of cells with the intracellular CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ chelator CHEMICAL__1_2_bis_2_aminophenoxy_ethane_N_N_N_N_tetraacetic_acid_tetrakis_acetoxymethyl_ester_ reduced CHEMICAL_D000242_cAMP levels in SPECIES_9606_PC1-knock-out cells.
28887310	Finally, the calmodulin inhibitors W-7 and W-13 reduced CHEMICAL_D000242_cAMP levels, and W-7 reduced cyst growth, suggesting that GENE_109_AC3 is involved in cyst growth regulated by GENE_10013_HDAC6.
28887310	We conclude that GENE_10013_HDAC6 inhibition reduces cell growth primarily by reducing intracellular CHEMICAL_D000242_cAMP and CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ levels.
28887310	Our results provide potential therapeutic targets that may be useful as treatments for ADPKD.
28888487	Impaired autophagic flux and GENE_23636_p62-mediated EMT are involved in CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced transformation of L-02 cells.
28888487	Autophagy is a catabolic process essential for preserving cellular homeostasis, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved during tissue development and DISEASE_D009369_cancer progression.
28888487	In CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-treated SPECIES_9606_human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells, CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite reduced the autophagic flux, which caused accumulation of GENE_23636_p62, an adaptor and receptor of autophagy.
28888487	Further, in CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-transformed L-02 cells, the levels of GENE_999_E_cadherin were attenuated, but the levels of GENE_7431_vimentin, which is expressed in mesenchymal cells, and GENE_6615_Snail, a transcription regulator of the EMT, were up-regulated.
28888487	Thus, after chronic exposure of L-02 cells to CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite, the impaired autophagic flux induced the accumulation of GENE_23636_p62, which up-regulated the expression of GENE_6615_Snail, a protein involved in CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced EMT of these cells.
28888487	Knockdown of GENE_23636_p62 by siRNA reversed the CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced EMT and decreased the capacities of CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-transformed L-02 cells for colony formation and invasion and migration.
28888487	Therefore, in CHEMICAL_C015001_arsenite-induced transformation of L-02 cells, the accumulation of GENE_23636_p62, by impairing autophagic flux, mediates the EMT via GENE_6615_Snail.
28888487	These results provide a previously unknown mechanism underlying DISEASE_D064420_arsenic_toxicity and carcinogenicity.
28892372	Transcriptomic Analysis of CHEMICAL_D013792_Thalidomide Challenged SPECIES_9031_Chick SPECIES_6239_Embryo Suggests Possible Link between Impaired Vasculogenesis and Defective Organogenesis.
28892372	Since the conception of CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide as a teratogen, approximately 30 hypotheses have been put forward to explain the developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of the molecule.
28892372	However, no systems biology approach has been taken to understand the phenomena yet.
28892372	The proposed work was aimed to explore the mechanism of CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide DISEASE_D064420_toxicity in developing SPECIES_9031_chick SPECIES_6239_embryo in the context of transcriptomics by using genome wide RNA sequencing data.
28892372	In this study, we challenged the developing SPECIES_6239_embryo at the stage of blood island formations (HH8), which is the most vulnerable stage for CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide-induced DISEASE_D009140_deformities.
28892372	We observed that CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide affected the early vasculogenesis through interfering with the blood island formation extending the effect to organogenesis.
28892372	The transcriptome analyses of the SPECIES_6239_embryos collected on sixth day of incubation showed that liver, eye, and blood tissue associated genes were down regulated due to CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide treatment.
28892372	The conserved gene coexpression module also indicated that the genes involved in lens development were heavily affected.
28892372	Further, the Gene Ontology analysis explored that the pathways of eye development, CHEMICAL_D014801_retinol metabolism, and cartilage development were dampened, consistent with the observed DISEASE_D009140_deformities of various organs.
28892372	The study concludes that CHEMICAL_D013792_thalidomide exerts its toxic teratogenic effects through interfering with early extra-embryonic vasculogenesis and ultimately gives an erroneous transcriptomic pattern to organogenesis.
28899902	Pharmacological inhibition of GENE_10090)_protein_tyrosine_phosphatase_1B protects against DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerotic_plaque formation in the GENE_10090)_LDLR-/- SPECIES_10090_mouse model of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28899902	DISEASE_D002318_Cardiovascular_disease (DISEASE_D002318_CVD) is the most prevalent cause of mortality among SPECIES_9606_patients with DISEASE_D017827_type 1 or DISEASE_D017827_type 2 DISEASE_D003920_diabetes, due to accelerated DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28899902	Recent evidence suggests a strong link between DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis and GENE_3630_insulin resistance, due to impaired GENE_3643_insulin_receptor (GENE_3643_IR) signalling.
28899902	Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting the activity of GENE_10090)_protein_tyrosine_phosphatase_1B (GENE_10090)_PTP1B), the major negative regulator of the IR prevents and reverses DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerotic_plaque formation in an GENE_10090)_LDLR-/- SPECIES_10090_mouse model of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis.
28899902	Acute (single dose) or chronic GENE_10090)_PTP1B inhibitor (CHEMICAL_C441128_trodusquemine) treatment of GENE_10090)_LDLR-/- SPECIES_10090_mice decreased DISEASE_D015430_weight_gain and adiposity, improved CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis and DISEASE_D050197_attenuated_atherosclerotic_plaque formation.
28899902	This was accompanied by a reduction in both, circulating total CHEMICAL_D002784_cholesterol and CHEMICAL_D014280_triglycerides, a decrease in aortic GENE_6347_monocyte_chemoattractant_protein_1 (GENE_6347_MCP_1) expression levels and hyperphosphorylation of aortic Akt/PKB and AMPKa.
28899902	Our findings are the first to demonstrate that GENE_5770_PTP1B inhibitors could be used in prevention and reversal of DISEASE_D050197_atherosclerosis development and reduction in DISEASE_D002318_CVD risk.
28903485	Editor's Highlight: Mechanistic Toxicity Tests Based on an Adverse Outcome Pathway Network for DISEASE_D005234_Hepatic_Steatosis.
28903485	Risk assessors use liver endpoints in rodent toxicology studies to assess the safety of chemical exposures.
28903485	Yet, rodent endpoints may not accurately reflect SPECIES_9606_human responses.
28903485	For this reason and others, SPECIES_9606_human-based invitro models are being developed and anchored to adverse outcome pathways to better predict adverse SPECIES_9606_human health outcomes.
28903485	Here, a networked adverse outcome pathway-guided selection of biology-based assays for lipid uptake, lipid efflux, CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid oxidation, and lipid accumulation were developed.
28903485	These assays were evaluated in a metabolically competent SPECIES_9606_human hepatocyte cell model (HepaRG) exposed to compounds known to cause DISEASE_D005234_steatosis (CHEMICAL_D000638_amiodarone, CHEMICAL_D016572_cyclosporine_A, and CHEMICAL_C423915_T0901317) or activate lipid metabolism pathways (CHEMICAL_C057693_troglitazone, CHEMICAL_C006253_Wyeth_14_643, and CHEMICAL_C003585_22_R_hydroxycholesterol).
28903485	All of the chemicals activated at least one assay, however, only CHEMICAL_C423915_T0901317 and CHEMICAL_D016572_cyclosporin_A dose-dependently increased lipid accumulation.
28903485	CHEMICAL_C423915_T0901317 and CHEMICAL_D016572_cyclosporin_A increased CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid uptake, decreased lipid efflux (inferred from GENE_338_apolipoprotein_B100 levels), and increased CHEMICAL_35366_fatty_acid synthase protein levels.
28903485	Using this biologically-based evaluation of key events regulating hepatic lipid levels, we demonstrated dysregulation of compensatory pathways that normally balance hepatic lipid levels.
28903485	This approach may provide biological plausibility and data needed to increase confidence in linking invitro-based measurements to chemical effects on adverse SPECIES_9606_human health outcomes.
28903495	RNA-Seq of SPECIES_9606_Human Neural Progenitor Cells Exposed to Lead (CHEMICAL__Pb) Reveals Transcriptome Dynamics, Splicing Alterations and Disease Risk Associations.
28903495	Lead (CHEMICAL__Pb) is a well-known toxicant, especially for the developing nervous system, albeit the mechanism is largely unknown.
28903495	In this study, we use time series RNA-seq to conduct a genome-wide survey of the transcriptome response of SPECIES_9606_human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells to lead treatment.
28903495	Using a dynamic time warping algorithm coupled with statistical tests, we find that lead can either accelerate or decelerate the expression of specific genes during the time series.
28903495	We further show that lead disrupts a neuron- and brain-specific splicing factor GENE_4857_NOVA1 regulated splicing network.
28903495	Using lead induced transcriptome change signatures, we predict several known and novel disease risks under lead exposure.
28903495	The findings in this study will allow a better understanding of the mechanism of lead DISEASE_D064420_toxicity, facilitate the development of diagnostic biomarkers and treatment for lead exposure, and comprise a highly valuable resource for environmental toxicology.
28903495	Our study also demonstrates that a SPECIES_9606_human (embryonic stem) cell-derived system can be used for studying the mechanism of toxicants, which can be useful for drug or compound DISEASE_D064420_toxicity screens and safety assessment.
28903497	Downregulation of TMEM70 in Rat Liver Cells After Hepatocarcinogen Treatment Related to the Warburg Effect in Hepatocarcinogenesis Producing GST-P-Expressing Proliferative Lesions.
28903497	We previously observed downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-related protein, TMEM70, which is suggestive of disrupted cellular senescence, in GST-P-expressing (+) proliferative lesions from early hepatocarcinogenesis stages in rats.
28903497	The present study investigated the immunohistochemical relationship between TMEM70 downregulation and cellular metabolic changes in carcinogenic processes, as well as the onset of the liver cell respiratory changes after repeated hepatocarcinogen treatment in rats.
28903497	At the early hepatocarcinogenesis stage in a 2-stage model, GST-P+ DISEASE_D011230_preneoplastic_lesions showing TMEM70 downregulation also downregulated the mitochondrial ATPase, ATPB, but upregulated glycolysis-related CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporter member 1 (GLUT1) and CHEMICAL_D019298_glucose_6_phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect.
28903497	Combined downregulation of TMEM70 and ATPB increased proliferation activity in GST-P+ DISEASE_D011230_preneoplastic_lesions, suggesting cell proliferation facilitation by reducing mitochondrial respiration.
28903497	Concurrent GLUT1-upregulation and TMEM70-downregulation increased nuclear phosphorylated c-MYC+ cells in GST-P+ DISEASE_D011230_preneoplastic_lesions, suggesting c-MYC-mediated transcription facilitation to promote glycolysis and cell proliferation.
28903497	The TMEM70-related metabolic shift was enhanced in GST-P+ neoplastic lesions, suggesting a contribution to DISEASE_D009369_tumor progression.
28903497	Conversely, the TMEM70-related metabolic shift was lacking in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a agonist-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, as well as in carcinogenic processes targeting other organs.
28903497	Transcript expression analysis following 28- and 90-day repeated hepatocarcinogen treatment showed downregulation of Tmem70 from day 28 and upregulation of Pkm and Myc at day 90, suggesting early onset of a catastrophic cellular senescence-related metabolic shift beginning from depressed mitochondrial respiration in the liver.
28903497	These results suggest a contribution of TMEM70 downregulation to the Warburg effect, which directs DISEASE_D009369_tumor promotion and progression in GST-P+-linked hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.
28904298	Usefulness of urinary biomarkers for nephrotoxicity in SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkeys treated with CHEMICAL_D005839_gentamicin, CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin, and CHEMICAL_D011692_puromycin_aminonucleoside.
28904298	The objective of this study was to investigate the availability of novel urinary biomarkers (BMs) such as total protein, albumin, b2-microglobulin, clusterin, GENE_102115978_cystatin_C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for the detection of acute nephrotoxicity in SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkeys.
28904298	Animals (total 9 males/3 groups) were administered CHEMICAL_D005839_gentamicin (GM) subcutaneously at 40 mg/kg for 7 days, CHEMICAL_D002945_cisplatin (CHEMICAL__CDDP) intravenously at 3 mg/kg once and CHEMICAL_D011692_puromycin_aminonucleoside (CHEMICAL_D011692_PAN) intravenously at 20 mg/kg for 7 days.
28904298	Two-hr urine on Days 0, 3, and 6, and 16-hr urine and blood on Days 1, 4, and 7 were collected.
28904298	Novel urinary BMs and conventional clinical pathology parameters were evaluated in parallel to histopathological and electron microscopic examinations on the kidneys at termination.
28904298	Urinary BMs and enzymes increased earlier than serum CHEMICAL_D003404_creatinine and blood CHEMICAL__urea_nitrogen, particularly in 2-hr urine after dosing on Day 0, urinary albumin was increased in all groups and urinary NGAL with the highest magnitude of change rate among urinary BMs was observed in the GM and CHEMICAL__CDDP groups.
28904298	DISEASE_D009336_Degeneration_necrosis and hyaline droplet of renal tubule, cellular cast and dilatation of renal tubule, and DISEASE_D006984_hypertrophy of podocytes were observed in the GEN, CHEMICAL__CDDP, and CHEMICAL_D011692_PAN groups, respectively.
28904298	These results showed that the increases of urinary BMs reflected the agent-specific renal damages and these urinary BMs could be useful for the detection of segment-specific nephrotoxicity.
28904298	Urinary albumin and NGAL are the most useful BMs to estimate glomerular and distal tubular damages, respectively, as well as proximal tubular damage in SPECIES_9541_cynomolgus_monkeys.
28903487	From the Cover: CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic Induces Hippocampal Neuronal Apoptosis and DISEASE_D003072_Cognitive_Impairments via an Up-Regulated GENE_10116)_BMP2/Smad-Dependent Reduced GENE_10116)_BDNF/GENE_10116)_TrkB Signaling in SPECIES_10116_Rats.
28903487	CHEMICAL_D001151_Arsenic promotes hippocampal DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_damage inducing DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_impairments.
28903487	However, mechanism arbitrating CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_deficits remains less-known.
28903487	Here, we identified that chronic exposure to environmentally relevant doses of CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic increased apoptosis, characterized by GENE_10116)_caspase_3 activation, CHEMICAL_D011064_poly_ADP_ribose_ polymerase cleavage and GENE_10116)_Terminal_deoxynucleotidyl_transferase CHEMICAL_17625_dUTP nick-end labeling of SPECIES_10116_rat hippocampal neurons, marked by GENE_10116)_NeuN.
28903487	Investigating apoptotic mechanism through invivo and invitro studies revealed that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic promoted GENE_10116)_bone_morphogenetic_protein_2 (GENE_10116)_BMP2) expression, supported by increased GENE_10116)_BMP_receptor2 (GENE_10116)_BMPR2) and p-Smad1/5 in hippocampal neurons.
28903487	GENE_10116)_BMP2-silencing and treatment with BMP antagonist, GENE_10116)_noggin, attenuated the CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-induced apoptosis and loss in hippocampal neurons.
28903487	We then investigated whether GENE_10116)_BMP2/Smad signaling stimulated neuronal apoptosis independently or required other intermediate pathways.
28903487	We hypothesized participation of GENE_10116)_brain_derived_neurotrophic_factor (GENE_10116)_BDNF) that promotes neuronal survival.
28903487	We identified an CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-mediated attenuation of GENE_10116)_BDNF-dependent GENE_10116)_TrkB signaling, and observed that co-treatment with recombinant-GENE_10116)_BDNF reinstated GENE_10116)_BDNF/GENE_10116)_TrkB and reduced neuronal apoptosis.
28903487	To probe whether GENE_10116)_BMP2/Smad and GENE_10116)_BDNF/GENE_10116)_TrkB pathways could be linked, we co-treated CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic with GENE_10116)_noggin or recombinant GENE_10116)_BDNF.
28903487	We detected a GENE_10116)_noggin-mediated restored GENE_10116)_BDNF/GENE_10116)_TrkB, while recombinant-GENE_10116)_BDNF failed to affect GENE_10116)_BMP2/Smad signaling.
28903487	In addition, we found that GENE_10116)_TrkB-inhibitor, CHEMICAL_C049985_K252a, nullified GENE_10116)_noggin-induced protection, proving the necessity of a downstream reduced GENE_10116)_BDNF/GENE_10116)_TrKB signaling for GENE_10116)_BMP2/Smad-mediated apoptosis in CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-treated neurons.
28903487	We further related our observations with cognitive performances, and detected GENE_10116)_noggin-mediated restoration of transfer latency time and learning-memory ability for passive avoidance and Y-Maze tests respectively in CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic-treated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28903487	Overall, our study proves that CHEMICAL_D001151_arsenic promotes hippocampal neuronal apoptosis through an up-regulated GENE_10116)_BMP2/Smad-dependent attenuation of GENE_10116)_BDNF/GENE_10116)_TrkB pathway, inducing DISEASE_D003072_cognitive_deficits.
28903489	From the Cover: Exposure to an Environmentally Relevant Mixture of Brominated Flame Retardants Decreased p-b-Cateninser675 Expression and Its Interaction With GENE_10116)_E_Cadherin in the Mammary Glands of Lactating SPECIES_10116_Rats.
28903489	Proper mammary gland development and function require precise hormonal regulation and bidirectional cross talk between cells provided by means of paracrine factors as well as intercellular junctions; exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors can disturb these processes.
28903489	Exposure to one such family of chemicals, the brominated flame retardants (BFRs), is ubiquitous.
28903489	Here, we tested the hypothesis that BFR exposures disrupt signaling pathways and intercellular junctions that control mammary gland development.
28903489	Before mating, during pregnancy and throughout lactation, female SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats were fed diets containing that BFR mixture based on house dust, delivering nominal exposures of BFR of 0 (control), 0.06, 20, or 60   mg/kg/d.
28903489	Dams were euthanized and mammary glands collected on postnatal day 21.
28903489	BFR exposure had no significant effects on mammary gland/body weight ratios or the levels of proteins involved in milk synthesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell-cell interactions, or hormone signalling.
28903489	However, BFR exposure (0.06   mg/kg/d) down-regulated phospho-ser675 GENE_1499_b_catenin (p-b-catSer675) levels in the absence of any effect on total GENE_1499_b_catenin levels.
28903489	Levels of p-CREB were also down-regulated, suggesting that PKA inhibition plays a role.
28903489	p-b-catSer675 co-localized with GENE_1499_b_catenin at the mammary epithelial cell membrane, and its expression was decreased in animals from the 0.06 and 20   mg/kg/d BFR treatment groups.
28903489	Although GENE_1499_b_Catenin signaling was not affected by BFR exposure, the interaction between p-b-catSer675 and GENE_999_E_cadherin was significantly reduced.
28903489	Together, our results demonstrate that exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of BFR during pregnancy and lactation decreases p-b-catser675 at cell adhesion sites, likely in a PKA-dependant manner, altering mammary gland signaling.
28903492	Editor's Highlight: GENE_10090)_Nlrp3 Is Required for Inflammatory Changes and Nigral Cell Loss Resulting From Chronic Intragastric CHEMICAL_D012402_Rotenone Exposure in SPECIES_10090_Mice.
28903492	Complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are widely believed to underlie the incidence and progression of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_disease (DISEASE_D010300_PD).
28903492	CHEMICAL_D012402_Rotenone is a naturally occurring metabolic toxin employed as an insecticide and piscicide identified as a risk factor for the development of DISEASE_D010300_PD in agricultural workers.
28903492	The GENE_114548_Nlrp3 inflammasome is an intracellular mediator that can initiate an inflammatory cascade in response to cellular stress.
28903492	Reports by others indicating that GENE_114548_NLRP3 expression was detectable in tissues obtained from DISEASE_D000544_Alzheimer_s_disease SPECIES_9606_patients and that the DISEASE_D010300_PD-associated protein a-synuclein could activate inflammasomes in cultured glial cells, prompted us to test the prediction that GENE_114548_Nlrp3 was required for the development of DISEASE_D010300_Parkinson_s_like_changes resulting from CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone exposure in SPECIES_10090_mice.
28903492	We exposed wild type and GENE_10090)_Nlrp3-/- SPECIES_10090_mice to chronic low doses of intragastric CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone and conducted longitudinal behavioral and serum cytokine analysis followed by evaluation of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative endpoints in brain tissues.
28903492	We observed progressive CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone-dependent changes in serum cytokine levels and circulating leukocytes in wild type SPECIES_10090_mice not observed in GENE_10090)_Nlrp3-/- SPECIES_10090_mice.
28903492	Analysis of brain tissues revealed GENE_10090)_Nlrp3-dependent neuroinflammation and nigral cell loss in SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone as compared with SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to vehicle alone.
28903492	Together, our findings provide compelling evidence of a role for GENE_114548_Nlrp3 in nigral DISEASE_D009410_degeneration_and_neuroinflammation resulting from systemic CHEMICAL_D012402_rotenone exposure and suggest that the suppression of GENE_114548_NLRP3 activity may be a rational neuroprotective strategy for toxin-associated DISEASE_D010300_PD.
28903499	The Long-Lasting Rodenticide CHEMICAL_C013418_Brodifacoum Induces Neuropathology in Adult SPECIES_9606_Male SPECIES_10116_Rats.
28903499	Superwarfarins are very long-lasting rodenticides effective in CHEMICAL_D014859_warfarin-resistant rodents at extremely low doses.
28903499	The consequences of chronic CHEMICAL_C013418_superwarfarin levels in tissues, due to biological half-lives on the order of 20 days, have not been examined.
28903499	We now characterized the neurological effects of CHEMICAL_C013418_brodifacoum (CHEMICAL__BDF), one of the most widely used superwarfarins, in adult SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats.
28903499	Dosing curves established the acute oral lethal dose for CHEMICAL__BDF as 221    14    g/kg.
28903499	Measurement of tissue CHEMICAL__BDF levels showed accumulation throughout the body, including the central nervous system, with levels diminishing over several days.
28903499	Immunocytochemical staining showed that both astrocyte and microglial activation was increased 4 days after CHEMICAL__BDF administration, as were levels of carbonylated proteins, and DISEASE_D009410_neuronal_damage assessed by CHEMICAL_C435731_fluorojade_B staining.
28903499	Direct toxic effects of CHEMICAL__BDF on neurons and glia were observed using enriched cultures of cerebellar neurons and cortical astrocytes.
28903499	Proteomic analysis of cerebellar lysates revealed that CHEMICAL__BDF altered expression of 667 proteins in adult SPECIES_10116_rats.
28903499	Gene ontology and pathway analysis identified changes in several functional pathways including cell metabolism, mitochondria function, and RNA handling with ribosomal proteins comprising the largest group.
28903499	In vitro studies using primary astrocytes showed that CHEMICAL__BDF suppressed de novo protein synthesis.
28903499	These findings demonstrate that CHEMICAL_C013418_superwarfarin accumulation increases indices of neuroinflammation and neuropathology in adult rodents, suggesting that methods which minimize CHEMICAL__BDF toxicity may not address delayed DISEASE_D009422_neurological_sequelae.
28903501	Sex-Differential Responses of Tumor Promotion-Associated Genes and Dysregulation of Novel Long Noncoding RNAs in GENE_10090)_Constitutive_Androstane_Receptor-Activated SPECIES_10090_Mouse Liver.
28903501	Xenobiotic agonists of GENE_9970_constitutive_androstane_receptor (GENE_9970_CAR) induce many hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes, but following prolonged exposure, promote DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma, most notably in SPECIES_9606_male SPECIES_10090_mouse liver.
28903501	Here, we used nuclear RNA-seq to characterize global changes in the SPECIES_10090_mouse liver transcriptome following exposure to the GENE_10090)_CAR-specific agonist ligand CHEMICAL_C028474_1_4_bis_2_3_5_dichloropyridyloxy_benzene (TCPOBOP), including changes in novel long noncoding RNAs that may contribute to xenobiotic-induced pathophysiology.
28903501	Protein-coding genes dysregulated by 3   h TCPOBOP exposure were strongly enriched in KEGG pathways of xenobiotic and drug metabolism, with stronger and more extensive gene responses observed in female than SPECIES_9606_male liver.
28903501	After 27   h TCPOBOP exposure, the number of responsive genes increased   >8-fold in SPECIES_9606_males, where the top enriched pathways and their upstream regulators expanded to include factors implicated in cell cycle dysregulation and DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma progression (GENE_595_cyclin_D1, oncogenes E2f, GENE_10413_Yap, Rb, GENE_4609_Myc, and proto-oncogenes GENE_1499_b_catenin, GENE_2305_FoxM1, GENE_2308_FoxO1, all predicted to be activated by TCPOBOP in SPECIES_9606_male but not female liver; and DISEASE_D009369_tumor suppressors GENE_644914_p21 and GENE_7157_p53, both predicted to be inhibited).
28903501	Upstream regulators uniquely associated with 3   h TCPOBOP-exposed females include GENE_7124_TNF/NFkB pathway members, which negatively regulate GENE_9970_CAR-dependent proliferative responses and may contribute to the relative resistance of female liver to TCPOBOP-induced DISEASE_D009369_tumor promotion.
28903501	These responses may be modified by the many long noncoding liver RNAs we show are dysregulated by TCPOBOP or GENE_8856_pregnane_X_receptor agonist exposure, including lncRNAs proximal to GENE_9970_CAR target genes Cyp2b10, GENE_5447_Por, and GENE_211_Alas1.
28903501	These data provide a comprehensive view of the GENE_10090)_CAR-regulated transcriptome and give insight into the mechanism of sex-biased susceptibility to GENE_10090)_CAR-dependent SPECIES_10090_mouse liver tumorigenesis.
28910977	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A induced apoptosis and transcriptome differences of spermatogonial stem cells in vitro.
28910977	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is widely used as an industrial plasticizer, which is also an endocrine disruptor and considered to have adverse effects on reproduction.
28910977	In male mammals, the long-term production of billions of spermatozoa relies on the regulated proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs).
28910977	However, little is known about the effects of CHEMICAL__BPA on the viability of SSCs.
28910977	To investigate the influence of CHEMICAL__BPA exposure on SSCs in vitro, we isolated SSCs from SPECIES_10090_mouse and successfully established in vitro propagation of SSCs.
28910977	After CHEMICAL__BPA treatment, we found that CHEMICAL__BPA reduced the viability of SSCs and induced SSC apoptosis.
28910977	For revealing the transcriptome differences of the CHEMICAL__BPA-treated SSCs, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing and found that 860 genes were differentially expressed among 18,272 observed genes.
28910977	The gene ontology (GO) terms, regulation of programmed cell death and apoptotic process, were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
28910977	Among the cluster of DEGs associated with the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) apoptosis pathway, GENE_10090)_activating_transcription_factor_4 (GENE_10090)_Atf4) and GENE_10090)_DNA_damage_inducible_transcript_3 (GENE_10090)_Ddit3) genes were significantly up-regulated in CHEMICAL__BPA-treated SSCs, which were proved by qPCR.
28910977	Taken together, these findings suggest that CHEMICAL__BPA can increase the mRNA expression of pro-apoptosis genes and reduce the viability of SSCs by inducing apoptosis.
28911802	Transient gestational exposure to drinking water containing excess CHEMICAL_C074702_hexavalent_chromium modifies GENE_3630_insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle of SPECIES_10116_rat progeny.
28911802	CHEMICAL_D002857_Chromium (CHEMICAL_D002857_Cr), an essential micronutrient potentiates GENE_3630_insulin action, whereas excess hexavalent CHEMICAL_D002857_Cr (CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI) acts as an endocrine disruptor.
28911802	Pregnant mothers living in areas abutting industries using the metal and chromite ore dumps are exposed to ground water contaminated with CHEMICAL_D002857_Cr.
28911802	Nevertheless, the impact of prenatal exposure to excess CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI on GENE_3630_insulin signaling in the progeny remains obscure.
28911802	We tested the hypothesis "transient gestational exposure to drinking water containing excess CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI may modify GENE_3630_insulin signaling during postnatal life".
28911802	Pregnant SPECIES_10116_Wistar_rats were given drinking water containing 50, 100 and 200  ppm CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI (K<sub>2</sub>CHEMICAL_D002857_Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) from gestational day 9-14 encompassing the period of organogenesis; the SPECIES_9606_male progenies were tested at postnatal day 60.
28911802	Neither fasting blood CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose nor oral CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose tolerance was altered in CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI treated progeny.
28911802	Nevertheless, western blot detection pointed out attenuated expression level of GENE_3643_insulin_receptor (GENE_3643_IR), its downstream signaling molecules (GENE_3667_IRS_1, pIRS-1<sup>Tyr632</sup>, GENE_207_Akt and pAkt<sup>Ser473</sup>) and organ specific CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose transporters (GENE_6514_GLUT2 in liver and GENE_6517_GLUT4 in gastrocnemius muscle), along with a significant increase in serum GENE_3630_insulin level in SPECIES_9606_male progenies exposed to CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI.
28911802	While<sup>14</sup>C-2-deoxy CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose uptake increased in the liver, the same DISEASE_D009135_decreased_in_the_skeletal_muscle whereas,<sup>14</sup>CHEMICAL__C_glucose oxidation recorded a consistent decrease in both tissues of CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI exposed SPECIES_10116_rats.
28911802	These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that transient gestational exposure to excess CHEMICAL_C074702_CrVI may affect GENE_3630_insulin signaling and CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose oxidation in the progeny, predictably rendering them vulnerable to GENE_3630_insulin resistance.
28916327	Glycogen metabolism in brain and neurons - astrocytes metabolic cooperation can be altered by pre- and neonatal lead (CHEMICAL__Pb) exposure.
28916327	Lead (CHEMICAL__Pb) is an environmental neurotoxin which particularly affects the developing brain but the molecular mechanism of its DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity still needs clarification.
28916327	The aim of this paper was to examine whether pre- and neonatal exposure to CHEMICAL__Pb (concentration of CHEMICAL__Pb in SPECIES_10116_rat offspring blood below the "threshold level") may affect the brain's energy metabolism in neurons and astrocytes via the amount of available glycogen.
28916327	We investigated the glycogen concentration in the brain, as well as the expression of the key enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism in brain: GENE_2997_glycogen_synthase_1 (GENE_2997_Gys1), glycogen phosphorylase (GENE_5837_PYGM, an isoform active in astrocytes; and GENE_5834_PYGB, an isoform active in neurons) and GENE_5257_phosphorylase_kinase_b (GENE_5257_PHKB).
28916327	Moreover, the expression of GENE_2697_connexin_43 (GENE_2697_Cx43) was evaluated to analyze whether CHEMICAL__Pb poisoning during the early phase of life may affect the neuron-astrocytes' metabolic cooperation.
28916327	This work shows for the first time that exposure to CHEMICAL__Pb in early life can impair brain energy metabolism by reducing the amount of glycogen and decreasing the rate of its metabolism.
28916327	This reduction in brain glycogen level was accompanied by a decrease in GENE_2997_Gys1 expression.
28916327	We noted a reduction in the immunoreactivity and the gene expression of both GENE_10116)_PYGB and GENE_10116)_PYGM isoform, as well as an increase in the expression of GENE_10116)_PHKB in CHEMICAL__Pb-treated SPECIES_10116_rats.
28916327	Moreover, exposure to CHEMICAL__Pb induced decrease in GENE_2697_connexin_43 immunoexpression in all the brain structures analyzed, both in astrocytes as well as in neurons.
28916327	Our data suggests that exposure to CHEMICAL__Pb in the pre- and neonatal periods results in a decrease in the level of brain glycogen and a reduction in the rate of its metabolism, thereby reducing CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose availability, which as a further consequence may lead to the DISEASE_D001928_impairment_of_brain_energy_metabolism and the metabolic cooperation between neurons and astrocytes.
28916335	CHEMICAL_C005865_Troxerutin abrogates mitochondrial oxidative stress and myocardial apoptosis in mice fed calorie-rich diet.
28916335	Mitochondrial oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of myocardial apoptosis in metabolic syndrome (MS) patients.
28916335	In this study, we investigated the effect of CHEMICAL_C005865_troxerutin (CHEMICAL__TX), an antioxidant on mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic markers in heart of mice fed fat and CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose-rich diet.
28916335	Adult male Mus musculus mice were fed either control diet or high fat, high CHEMICAL_D005632_fructose diet (HFFD) for 60 days to induce MS. Mice from each dietary group were divided into two on the 16th day and were either treated or untreated with CHEMICAL__TX (150  mg/kg bw, p.o) for the next 45 days.
28916335	At the end of the study, mitochondrial reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) generation, oxidative stress markers, levels of intracellular CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium, cardiolipin content, cytochrome c release and apoptotic markers were examined in the myocardium.
28916335	HFFD-feeding resulted in diminution of antioxidants and increased ROS production, lipid peroxidation and oxidatively modified adducts of CHEMICAL__8_OHG, CHEMICAL__4_HNE and 3-NT.
28916335	Further increase in CHEMICAL_29108_Ca2_ levels, low levels of CHEMICAL_D002118_calcium transporters and decrease in CHEMICAL_D002308_cardiolipin content were noted.
28916335	Changes in the mitochondrial structure were observed by electron microscopy.
28916335	Furthermore, cytochrome c release, increase in proapoptotic proteins (APAF-1, BAX, caspases-9 and-3) and decrease in antiapoptotic protein (BCL-2) in HFFD-fed mice suggest myocardial apoptosis.
28916335	These changes were significantly restored by CHEMICAL__TX supplementation.
28916335	CHEMICAL__TX administration effectively attenuated cardiac apoptosis and exerted a protective role by increasing antioxidant potential and by improving mitochondrial function.
28916335	Thus, CHEMICAL__TX could be a promising therapeutic candidate for treating cardiac disease in MS patients.
28918123	CHEMICAL_C018381_Carnosic_acid induces apoptosis of DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma cells via ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway.
28918123	CHEMICAL_C018381_Carnosic_acid (DISEASE_D000592_CA), an important bioactive CHEMICAL__phenolic_diterpene mainly found in labiate plants, exerts various biological functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and neuroprotective activities.
28918123	In the present study, we proved the deleterious effects of DISEASE_D000592_CA against DISEASE_D006528_hepatocellular_carcinoma (DISEASE_D006528_HCC) in both in  vitro and in  vivo models.
28918123	In  vitro, DISEASE_D000592_CA significantly decreased cell viability, inhibited cell proliferation and migration, enhanced apoptosis, and increased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities in HepG2 and SMMC-7721  cells.
28918123	Specifically, DISEASE_D000592_CA led to a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increases in intracellular reactive CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptosis-related protein expression.
28918123	Pre-incubation of DISEASE_D006528_HCC cells with CHEMICAL_D000111_N_Acetyl_l_cysteine (CHEMICAL__NAC), a ROS inhibitor, strongly suppressed DISEASE_D000592_CA-induced apoptotic phenomena, including reduced cell viability, excessive ROS levels, MMP decreases, and abnormal protein expression, suggesting an association of DISEASE_D000592_CA-induced apoptosis with oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial pathways.
28918123	In HepG2-and SMMC-7721-xenograft DISEASE_D009369_tumor mouse models, treatment with DISEASE_D000592_CA inhibited DISEASE_D009369_tumor growth and modulated apoptosis-related protein expression, confirming the anti-DISEASE_D006528_HCC effects of this chemical.
28918123	Moreover, the DISEASE_D000592_CA-mediated anti-DISEASE_D006528_HCC effects associated with oxidative stress provide experimental evidence to support the potential use of DISEASE_D000592_CA as a drug therapy for DISEASE_D006528_HCC.
28918527	Alterations in epididymal proteomics and antioxidant activity of SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride.
28918527	It is well known that high CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride results in low fertility.
28918527	Epididymis is the important place for spermatozoa maturation, which is essential for successful fertilization.
28918527	In the previous studies, CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride was reported to damage the epididymal structure of SPECIES_10090_mouse and SPECIES_9986_rabbit.
28918527	However, the mechanism underlying CHEMICAL_D012969_sodium_fluoride (CHEMICAL_28741_NaF)-induced DISEASE_D064420_epididymal_toxicity has not yet been well elucidated.
28918527	The aim of this study is to explore the global protein alterations in epididymis of SPECIES_10090_mice exposed to CHEMICAL_28741_NaF using the iTRAQ technique.
28918527	Results showed that 211 proteins were differentially expressed in both 25 and 100  mg/L CHEMICAL_28741_NaF groups.
28918527	Some of them have been proved to be important for reproduction, such as GENE_10090)_low_density_lipoprotein_receptor_related_protein_2 (GENE_10090)_Lrp2), cytochrome c, testis-specific (GENE_10090)_Cyct), CHEMICAL_D013012_sorbitol dehydrogenase (Sord), CHEMICAL__glutathione_S-transferases (GSTs), GENE_10090)_acrosin, GENE_10090)_beta_defensin_126, GENE_10090)_cysteine_rich_secretory_protein_Crisp_1, and GENE_10090)_Crisp2.
28918527	Gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested cellular process, organelle and catalytic activity account for high percent and number of differentially expressed proteins.
28918527	171 pathways were found after the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, among which the representative maps, such as ribosome, focal adhesion, and phagosome, were involved.
28918527	Different functional categories post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones; translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; cytoskeleton; energy production and conversion are implicated in the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) of proteins analysis.
28918527	Subsequently, the effect of CHEMICAL_28741_NaF on the antioxidant activity in epididymis, especially CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-related enzymes, was evaluated.
28918527	Results exhibited high CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride caused low total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), high methane CHEMICAL__dicarboxylic_aldehyde (MDA), decreased reduced CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione (CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH), and the CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-related enzymes [CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH peroxidase (GPx), CHEMICAL_D005978_GSH reductase (GR), and CHEMICAL__GSH_S-transferase (GST)] changes in activity, protein, and mRNA expressions.
28918527	In summary, CHEMICAL_28741_NaF decreased the antioxidant activity of epididymis, especially CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione and CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione-related enzymes, as well as iTRAQ results, providing new explanations for the low sperm quality induced by CHEMICAL_D005459_fluoride.
28919491	Potential involvement of GENE_10116)_Fgf10/GENE_10116)_Fgfr2 and CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptor (GENE_10116)_AR) in DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis in adult male SPECIES_10116_rat offspring subjected to prenatal exposure to CHEMICAL_D003993_di_n_butyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_35861_DBP).
28919491	BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_D003993_di_n_butyl_phthalate (CHEMICAL_35861_DBP) induces DISEASE_C535662_dysplasia of the kidney in newborn male offspring and DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis in adults.
28919491	But the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.
28919491	GENE_10116)_Fgf10/GENE_10116)_Fgfr2 and GENE_10116)_androgen_receptor (GENE_10116)_AR) are known to be important for renal development.
28919491	We therefore investigated whether these genes are involved in CHEMICAL_35861_DBP-induced DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis.
28919491	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using SPECIES_10116_Sprague_Dawley_rats and SPECIES_10116_rat renal proximal tubular cells (NRK52E), we determined the potential involvement of GENE_10116)_Fgf10, GENE_10116)_Fgfr2 and GENE_10116)_AR in CHEMICAL_35861_DBP-induced DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis.
28919491	RESULTS: We found that maternal exposure to CHEMICAL_35861_DBP induces DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis in adult male offspring.
28919491	A lower serum CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone concentration and reduced expression of GENE_10116)_Fgf10, GENE_10116)_Fgfr2 and GENE_10116)_AR were detected in these animals.
28919491	These was a trend toward lower expression of GENE_10116)_Fgf10, GENE_10116)_Fgfr2 and GENE_10116)_AR in NRK52E cells subjected to CHEMICAL_35861_DBP exposure.
28919491	Furthermore, higher expression levels of GENE_10116)_TGF_b and a-SMA were observed in abnormal renal tissue and CHEMICAL_35861_DBP-treated NRK52E cells.
28919491	CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the potential involvement of GENE_10116)_Fgf10/GENE_10116)_Fgfr2 and GENE_10116)_AR in DISEASE_D007674_renal_fibrosis of adult male SPECIES_10116_rat offspring induced by prenatal exposure to CHEMICAL_35861_DBP.
28919491	The anti-androgenic effects of CHEMICAL_35861_DBP might play an important role in this pathological process.
28916286	Toxicology studies of CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate using a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro SPECIES_9606_human liver aggregate model.
28916286	CHEMICAL__Primycin_sulphate is a highly effective compound against Gram (G) positive bacteria.
28916286	It has a potentially synergistic effect with CHEMICAL_D014640_vancomycin and statins which makes CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate a potentially very effective preparation.
28916286	CHEMICAL__Primycin_sulphate is currently used exclusively in topical preparations.
28916286	In vitro animal hepatocyte and neuromuscular junction studies (in SPECIES_10090_mice, SPECIES_10116_rats, snakes, frogs) as well as in in vitro SPECIES_9606_human red blood cell experiments were used to test DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28916286	During these studies, the use of CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate resulted in reduced cellular membrane integrity and modified ion channel activity.
28916286	Additionally, parenteral administration of CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate to SPECIES_10090_mice, SPECIES_9615_dogs, SPECIES_9685_cats, SPECIES_9986_rabbits and SPECIES_10141_guinea_pigs indicated high level of acute DISEASE_D064420_toxicity.
28916286	The objective of this study was to reveal the cytotoxic and gene expression modifying effects of CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate in a SPECIES_9606_human system using an in vitro, three dimensional (3D) human hepatic model system.
28916286	Within the 3D model, CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate presented no acute DISEASE_D064420_cytotoxicity at concentrations 1 g/ml and below.
28916286	However, even at low concentrations, CHEMICAL__primycin_sulphate affected gene expressions by up-regulating inflammatory cytokines (e.g., GENE_3569_IL6), chemokines (e.g., GENE_6374_CXCL5) and by down-regulating molecules of the lipid metabolism (e.g., peroxisome proliferator receptor (GENE_5465_PPAR_alpha, gamma, etc).
28916286	Down-regulation of GENE_5465_PPAR_alpha cannot just disrupt lipid production but can also affect GENE_1576_cytochrome_P450_metabolic_enzyme_CYP_3A4 expression, highlighting the need for extensive drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies before SPECIES_9606_human oral or parenteral preparations can be developed.
28922406	Loss of liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression by GENE_10090)_aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor activation in C57BL/6 SPECIES_10090_mice.
28922406	The CHEMICAL__aryl_hydrocarbon receptor (GENE_10090)_AhR) is a highly conserved transcription factor that mediates a broad spectrum of species-, strain-, sex-, age-, tissue-, and cell-specific responses elicited by structurally diverse ligands including CHEMICAL_D013749_2_3_7_8_tetrachlorodibenzo_p_dioxin (CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD).
28922406	Dose-dependent effects on liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression were examined in male and female SPECIES_10090_mice gavaged with CHEMICAL_D013749_TCDD every 4 days for 28 or 92 days.
28922406	RNA-seq data revealed the coordinated repression of 181 genes predominately expressed in the liver including albumin (3.7-fold), a-fibrinogen (14.5-fold), and b-fibrinogen (17.4-fold) in males with corresponding GENE_10090)_AhR enrichment at 2 hr.
28922406	Liver-specific genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression also demonstrated diminished divergence between sexes.
28922406	For example, male-biased GENE_10090)_Gstp1 was repressed 3.0-fold in males and induced 4.5-fold in females, which were confirmed at the protein level.
28922406	Disrupted regulation is consistent with impaired GENE_10090)_GHR-GENE_10090)_JAK2-GENE_10090)_STAT5 signaling and inhibition of female specific GENE_10090)_CUX2-mediated transcription as well as the repression of other key transcriptional regulators including GENE_10090)_Ghr, GENE_10090)_Stat5b, GENE_10090)_Bcl6, GENE_10090)_Hnf4a, GENE_10090)_Hnf6, GENE_15375;15376;15377_Foxa1_2_3, and GENE_10090)_Zhx2.
28922406	Attenuated liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression was concurrent with the induction of fetal genes such as alpha-fetoprotein.
28922406	The results suggest GENE_10090)_AhR activation causes the loss of liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression producing a functionally "de-differentiated" hepatic phenotype.
28917655	Inactivation of GENE_10090)_TNF/LT locus alters SPECIES_10090_mouse metabolic response to concentrated ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>.
28917655	BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is associated with increased cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality.
28917655	This is widely believed to be attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub>exposure-induced DISEASE_D011014_pulmonary_and_subsequent_systemic_inflammation.
28917655	DISEASE_D009336_Tumor_necrosis factor alpha (GENE_7124_TNFa), lymphotoxin a (GENE_10090)_LTa), and GENE_4050_lymphotoxin_b (GENE_4050_LTb) are three homologous pro-inflammatory cytokines, each with both unique and redundant activities in DISEASE_D007249_inflammation.
28917655	Their role in PM<sub>2.5</sub>exposure-induced DISEASE_D007249_inflammation and adverse cardiometabolic effects has to be determined.
28917655	METHODS AND RESULTS: GENE_10090)_LTa/GENE_10090)_TNFa/GENE_10090)_LTb triple-knockout (GENE_10090)_TNF_LT_KO) and wildtype (WT) SPECIES_10090_mice were exposed to concentrated ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>(CAP) for 5 months.
28917655	Lung pathological analysis revealed that DISEASE_C536657_TNF_LT_deficiency reduced CAP exposure-induced DISEASE_D011014_pulmonary_inflammation.
28917655	However, CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis assessments showed that DISEASE_C536657_TNF_LT_deficiency significantly aggravated CAP exposure-induced DISEASE_D018149_glucose_intolerance and insulin resistance.
28917655	Consistent with CHEMICAL_D005947_glucose homeostasis assessments, CAP exposure significantly increased the body weight and adiposity of GENE_10090)_TNF_LT_KO but not WT SPECIES_10090_mice.
28917655	In contrast to its body weight effects, CAP exposure reduced food intake of WT but not GENE_10090)_TNF_LT_KO SPECIES_10090_mice.
28917655	On the other hand, CAP exposure induced marked fat droplet accumulation in brown adipose tissues of WT SPECIES_10090_mice and significantly decreased their GENE_10090)_uncoupling_protein_1 (GENE_10090)_UCP1) expression, and these effects were markedly exacerbated in GENE_10090)_TNF/LT KO SPECIES_10090_mice.
28917655	CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that GENE_7124_TNF/LT deficiency influences PM<sub>2.5</sub>exposure-induced response of energy metabolism through alterations in both food intake and energy expenditure.
28919305	CHEMICAL_C005498_Magnolol protects pancreatic b-cells against CHEMICAL_D011765_methylglyoxal-induced cellular dysfunction.
28919305	DISEASE_D006943_Chronic_hyperglycemia aggravates insulin resistance, in part due to increased formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).
28919305	CHEMICAL_D011765_Methylglyoxal (MG), a major precursor of AGEs, accumulates abnormally in various tissues and organs and participates in oxidative damage.
28919305	We investigated the insulinotropic benefits of CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol, a CHEMICAL__hydroxylated_biphenyl compound isolated from Magnolia officinalis, in pancreatic b-cells exposed to MG in  vitro.
28919305	When exposed to cytotoxic levels of MG for 48  h, RIN-m5F b-cells exhibited a significant DISEASE_D034381_loss_of_viability and DISEASE_D003072_impaired_insulin_secretion, whereas pretreatment with CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol protected against MG-induced cell death and decreased insulin secretion.
28919305	Moreover, CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol increased the expression of genes involved in b-cell survival and function, including Ins2 and PDX1.
28919305	Furthermore, CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol increased the levels of AMPK phosphorylation, SIRT1, and PGC1a in RIN-5F b-cells.
28919305	In addition, CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol increased the activity of glyoxalase I and decreased the levels of MG-modified protein adducts, which suggests that CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol protects against MG-induced protein glycation.
28919305	Taken together, the results indicate the potential application of CHEMICAL_C005498_magnolol as an intervention against MG-induced DISEASE_D006943_hyperglycemia.
28919358	Perfused SPECIES_9606_human hepatocyte microtissues identify reactive metabolite-forming and mitochondria-perturbing hepatotoxins.
28919358	Hepatotoxins cause DISEASE_D008107_liver_damage via many mechanisms but the formation of reactive metabolites and/or damage to liver mitochondria are commonly implicated.
28919358	We assess 3D human primary hepatocyte microtissues as a platform for hepatotoxicity studies with reactive metabolite-forming and mitochondria-perturbing compounds.
28919358	We show that microtissues formed from cryopreserved SPECIES_9606_human hepatocytes had bile canaliculi, transcribed mRNA from genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and expressed functional GENE_4051_cytochrome_P450 enzymes.
28919358	Hierarchical clustering was used to distinguish dose-dependent hepatotoxicity elicited by CHEMICAL_D003024_clozapine, CHEMICAL_C043457_fialuridine and CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen (CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP) from control cultures and less liver-damaging compounds, CHEMICAL_C076029_olanzapine and CHEMICAL_C413685_entecavir.
28919358	The regio-isomer of CHEMICAL_D000082_acetaminophen, CHEMICAL__N_acetyl_meta_aminophenol (CHEMICAL__AMAP) clustered with the hepatotoxic compounds.
28919358	The principal metabolites of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP were formed and dose-dependent changes in metabolite profile similar to those seen in SPECIES_9606_patient DISEASE_D062787_overdose was observed.
28919358	The toxicological profile of CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP was indistinguishable from that of CHEMICAL__AMAP, confirming CHEMICAL__AMAP as a SPECIES_9606_human hepatotoxin.
28919358	Tissue CHEMICAL_D010100_oxygen consumption rate was significantly decreased within 2h of exposure to CHEMICAL_D000082_APAP or CHEMICAL__AMAP, concomitant with CHEMICAL_D005978_glutathione depletion.
28919358	These data highlight the potential utility of perfused metabolically functional SPECIES_9606_human liver microtissues in drug development and mechanistic toxicology.
28919515	GENE_10090)_Trace_amine_associated_receptor_1 regulation of CHEMICAL_D008694_methamphetamine-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity.
28919515	GENE_10090)_Trace_amine_associated_receptor_1 (GENE_10090)_TAAR1) is activated by CHEMICAL_D008694_methamphetamine (MA) and modulates dopaminergic (DA) function.
28919515	Although DA dysregulation is the hallmark of MA-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity leading to DISEASE_D003072_behavioral_and_cognitive_deficits, the intermediary role of GENE_10090)_TAAR1 has yet to be characterized.
28919515	To investigate GENE_10090)_TAAR1 regulation of MA-induced DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxicity, GENE_10090)_Taar1 transgenic knock-out (KO) and wildtype (WT) SPECIES_10090_mice were administered saline or a DISEASE_D020258_neurotoxic regimen of 4 i.p.
28919515	injections, 2h apart, of MA (2.5, 5, or 10mg/kg).
28919515	Temperature data were recorded during the treatment day.
28919515	Additionally, striatal tissue was collected 2 or 7days following MA administration for analysis of DA, CHEMICAL_D015102_3_4_dihydroxyphenylacetic_acid (CHEMICAL_D015102_DOPAC), CHEMICAL_D006719_homovanillic_acid (CHEMICAL_545959_HVA), and CHEMICAL_D014443_tyrosine hydroxylase (GENE_10090)_TH) levels, as well as GENE_10090)_glial_fibrillary_acidic_protein (GENE_10090)_GFAP) expression.
28919515	MA elicited an acute hypothermic drop in body temperature in GENE_10090)_Taar1-WT SPECIES_10090_mice, but not in GENE_10090)_Taar1-KO SPECIES_10090_mice.
28919515	Two days following treatment, DA and GENE_10090)_TH levels were lower in GENE_10090)_Taar1-KO SPECIES_10090_mice compared to GENE_10090)_Taar1-WT SPECIES_10090_mice, regardless of treatment, and were dose-dependently decreased by MA.
28919515	GENE_10090)_GFAP expression was significantly increased by all doses of MA at both time points and greater in GENE_10090)_Taar1-KO compared to GENE_10090)_Taar1-WT SPECIES_10090_mice receiving MA 2.5 or 5mg/kg.
28919515	Seven days later, DA levels were decreased in a similar pattern: DA was significantly lower in GENE_10090)_Taar1-KO compared to GENE_10090)_Taar1-WT SPECIES_10090_mice receiving MA 2.5 or 5mg/kg.
28919515	GENE_10090)_TH levels were uniformly decreased by MA, regardless of genotype.
28919515	These results indicate that activation of GENE_10090)_TAAR1 potentiates MA-induced DISEASE_D007035_hypothermia and GENE_10090)_TAAR1 confers sustained neuroprotection dependent on its thermoregulatory effects.
28927898	Developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity assessment of common excipients using a stem cell-based in  vitro morphogenesis model.
28927898	Various chemical compounds can inflict developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity when sufficiently high concentrations are exposed to SPECIES_6239_embryos at the critical stages of development.
28927898	Excipients, such as coloring agents and preservatives, are pharmacologically inactive ingredients that are included in various medications, foods, and cosmetics.
28927898	However, concentrations that may adversely affect SPECIES_6239_embryo development are largely unknown for most excipients.
28927898	Here, the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) to inflict developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity was assessed for three coloring agents (allura red, CHEMICAL_C006796_brilliant_blue, and CHEMICAL_D013645_tartrazine) and three preservatives (CHEMICAL_D002083_butylated_hydroxyanisole, CHEMICAL_C030981_metabisulfite, and CHEMICAL_C015358_methylparaben).
28927898	Adverse impact of a compound exposure was determined using the stem cell-based in  vitro morphogenesis model, in which three-dimensional cell aggregates, or embryoid bodies (EBs), recapitulate embryonic processes of body axis elongation and patterning.
28927898	LOAEL to impair EB morphogenesis was 200   M for CHEMICAL_C015358_methylparaben, 400   M for CHEMICAL_D002083_butylated_hydroxyanisole, 600   M for allura red and CHEMICAL_C006796_brilliant_blue, and 1000   M for metabisulfite.
28927898	Gene expression analyses of excipient-treated EBs revealed that CHEMICAL_D002083_butylated_hydroxyanisole and CHEMICAL_C015358_methylparaben significantly altered profiles of developmental regulators involved in axial elongation and patterning of the body.
28927898	The present study may provide a novel in  vitro approach to investigate potential developmental DISEASE_D064420_toxicity of common excipients with mechanistic insights.
28928807	Effects of low dose of CHEMICAL_C006780_bisphenol_A on the proliferation and mechanism of primary cultured prostate epithelial cells in rodents.
28928807	CHEMICAL_C006780_Bisphenol_A (CHEMICAL__BPA) is a well-known endocrine disruptor compound (EDC) that aggravates CHEMICAL_D013739_testosterone-induced DISEASE_D011470_benign_prostate_hyperplasia by increasing the relative weight of the ventral and dorsolateral prostate in SPECIES_10116_rats.
28928807	This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the exogenous CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen effect of CHEMICAL__BPA.
28928807	However, the direct effect of CHEMICAL__BPA on prostate cells has not been characterized.
28928807	The present study investigated the proliferative effect and possible mechanisms of action of CHEMICAL__BPA on the prostatic epithelium of SPECIES_10116_rats.
28928807	The ventral prostate epithelial cells were cultured in vitro and the proliferation effects of CHEMICAL__BPA on cells were studied.
28928807	The cells were identified as prostatic epithelial cells, and cell viability, cell apoptosis and the expressions of CHEMICAL_50113_androgen receptors (DISEASE_D013734_AR) and CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors (ER), were detected.
28928807	It was observed that 0.01-1 nM CHEMICAL__BPA promoted cell growth, with 1 nM CHEMICAL__BPA inducing the greatest increase in the rate of cell growth.
28928807	However, CHEMICAL__BPA-treated cells exhibited no marked morphological changes compared with the control group.
28928807	The cell apoptosis rate in each CHEMICAL__BPA-treated group was lower compared with the control group.
28928807	The expression levels of ERa and ERb increased, but the expression of DISEASE_D013734_AR decreased.
28928807	The present study demonstrated that environmental exposure to CHEMICAL__BPA directly promoted the proliferation of prostate cells in SPECIES_10116_rats through increasing the expression of CHEMICAL_D004967_estrogen receptors, reducing the expression of DISEASE_D013734_androgen_receptors of the cells and decreasing apoptosis-induced cell death.
